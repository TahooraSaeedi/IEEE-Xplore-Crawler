        "abstract": "The rise of generative AI has led many companies to hire freelanc-ers to harness its potential. However, this technology presents unique challenges to developers who have not previously engaged with it. Freelancers may find these challenges daunting due to the absence of organizational support and their reliance on positive client feedback. In a study involving 52 freelance developers, we identified multiple challenges associated with developing solutions based on generative AI. Freelancers often struggle with as-pects they perceive as unique to generative AI such as unpredict-ability of its output, the occurrence of hallucinations, and the in-consistent effort required due to trial-and-error prompting cycles. Further, the limitations of specific frameworks, such as token lim-its and long response times, add to the complexity. Hype-related issues, such as inflated client expectations and a rapidly evolving technological ecosystem, further exacerbate the difficulties. To address these issues, we propose Software Engineering for Generative AI (SE4GenAI) and Hype-Induced Software Engineering (HypeSE) as areas where the software engineering community can provide effective guidance. This support is essential for freelancers working with generative AI and other emerging technologies.",

        "abstract": "Smart contracts are integral to blockchain's growth, but their vulnerabilities pose a significant threat. Traditional vulnerability detection methods rely heavily on expert-defined complex rules that are labor-intensive and difficult to adapt to the explosive expansion of smart contracts. Some recent studies of neural network-based vulnerability detection also have room for improvement. Therefore, we propose SCVHUNTER, an extensible framework for smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, SCVHUNTER designs a heterogeneous semantic graph construction phase based on intermediate representations and a vulnerability detection phase based on a heterogeneous graph attention network for smart contracts. In particular, SCVHUNTER allows users to freely point out more important nodes in the graph, leveraging expert knowledge in a simpler way to aid the automatic capture of more information related to vulnerabilities. We tested SCVHUNTER on reentrancy, block info dependency, nested call, and transaction state dependency vulnerabilities. Results show remarkable performance, with accuracies of 93.72%, 91.07%, 85.41%, and 87.37% for these vulnerabilities, surpassing previous methods.",

        "abstract": "Vulnerability analysis is crucial for software security. Inspired by the success of pre-trained models on software engineering tasks, this work focuses on using pre-training techniques to enhance the understanding of vulnerable code and boost vulnerability analysis. The code understanding ability of a pre-trained model is highly related to its pre-training objectives. The semantic structure, e.g., control and data dependencies, of code is important for vulnerability analysis. However, existing pre-training objectives either ignore such structure or focus on learning to use it. The feasibility and benefits of learning the knowledge of analyzing semantic structure have not been investigated. To this end, this work proposes two novel pre-training objectives, namely Control Dependency Prediction (CDP) and Data Dependency Prediction (DDP), which aim to predict the statement-level control dependencies and token-level data dependencies, respectively, in a code snippet only based on its source code. During pre-training, CDP and DDP can guide the model to learn the knowledge required for analyzing fine-grained dependencies in code. After pre-training, the pre-trained model can boost the understanding of vulnerable code during fine-tuning and can directly be used to perform dependence analysis for both partial and complete functions. To demonstrate the benefits of our pre-training objectives, we pre-train a Transformer model named PDBERT with CDP and DDP, fine-tune it on three vulnerability analysis tasks, i.e., vulnerability detection, vulnerability classification, and vulnerability assessment, and also evaluate it on program dependence analysis. Experimental results show that PDBERT benefits from CDP and DDP, leading to state-of-the-art performance on the three downstream tasks. Also, PDBERT achieves F1-scores of over 99% and 94% for predicting control and data dependencies, respectively, in partial and complete functions.",

To guarantee a fair evaluation, we employ a carefully-labeled benchmark and introduce a set of pragmatic performance metrics, evaluating fuzzers from five complementary perspectives.

        "abstract": "Smart contracts are Turing-complete programs that execute on the blockchain. Developers can implement complex contracts, such as auctions and lending, on Ethereum using the Solidity programming language. As an object-oriented language, Solidity provides libraries within its syntax to facilitate code reusability and reduce development complexity. Library misuse refers to the incorrect writing or usage of libraries, resulting in unexpected results, such as introducing vulnerabilities during library development or incorporating an unsafe library during contract development. Library misuse could lead to contract defects that cause financial losses. Currently, there is a lack of research on library misuse. To fill this gap, we collected more than 500 audit reports from the official websites of five audit companies and 223,336 real-world smart contracts from Etherscan to measure library popularity and library misuse. Then, we defined eight general patterns for library misuse; three of them occurring during library development and five during library utilization, which covers the entire library lifecycle. To validate the practicality of these patterns, we manually analyzed 1,018 realworld smart contracts and publicized our dataset. We identified 905 misuse cases across 456 contracts, indicating that library misuse is a widespread issue. Three patterns of misuse are found in more than 50 contracts, primarily due to developers lacking security awareness or underestimating negative impacts. Additionally, our research revealed that vulnerable libraries on Ethereum continue to be employed even after they have been deprecated or patched. Our findings can assist contract developers in preventing library misuse and ensuring the safe use of libraries.",

        "abstract": "Privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA have greatly affected online advertising and tracking strategies. To comply with the regulations, websites need to display consent management UIs (i.e., cookie banners) implemented under the corresponding technical frameworks, allowing users to specify consents regarding their personal data processing. Although prior works have investigated the cookie banner compliance problems with GDPR, the technical specification has significantly changed. The compliance status under the latest framework remains unclear. There also lacks a systematic study of CCPA banner compliance. More importantly, most work have focused on detecting the regulation violations, whereas little is known about the possible culprits and causes. In this paper, we develop CSCHECKER, a browser-based tool that monitors and records consent strings on websites. We use CSCHECKER to analyze the GDPR and CCPA cookie banners, and reveal previously unknown compliance problems under both frame-works. We also discover and analyze possible miscreants leading to the violations, e.g., consent management providers that return wrong consent data. The comparison of the two frameworks inspires several suggestions about the design of cookie banners, the implementation of opt-out mechanisms, and the enforcement of user consent choices.",

        "abstract": "Currently, smart contract vulnerabilities (SCVs) have emerged as a major factor threatening the transaction security of blockchain. Existing state-of-the-art methods rely on deep learning to mitigate this threat. They treat each input contract as an independent entity and feed it into a deep learning model to learn vulnerability patterns by fitting vulnerability labels. It is a pity that they disregard the correlation between contracts, failing to consider the commonalities between contracts of the same type and the differences among contracts of different types. As a result, the performance of these methods falls short of the desired level. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Contrastive Learning Enhanced Automated Recognition Approach for Smart Contract Vulnerabilities, named Clear. In particular, Clear employs a con-trastive learning (CL) model to capture the fine-grained correlation information among contracts and generates correlation labels based on the relationships between contracts to guide the training pro-cess of the CL model. Finally, it combines the correlation and the semantic information of the contract to detect SCVs. Through an empirical evaluation of a large-scale real-world dataset of over 40K smart contracts and compare 13 state-of-the-art baseline methods. We show that Clear achieves (1) optimal performance over all base-line methods; (2) 9.73%-39.99% higher F1-score than existing deep learning methods.",

        "abstract": "Ponzi schemes, a form of scam, have been discovered in Ethereum smart contracts in recent years, causing massive financial losses. Rule-based detection approaches rely on predefined rules with limited capabilities and domain knowledge dependency. Additionally, using static information like opcodes and transactions for machine learning models fails to effectively characterize the Ponzi contracts, resulting in poor reliability and interpretability. In this paper, we propose PonziGuard, an efficient Ponzi scheme detection approach based on contract runtime behavior. Inspired by the observation that a contract's runtime behavior is more effective in disguising Ponzi contracts from the innocent contracts, Ponzi-Guard establishes a comprehensive graph representation called contract runtime behavior graph (CRBG), to accurately depict the behavior of Ponzi contracts. Furthermore, it formulates the detection process as a graph classification task, enhancing its overall effectiveness. We conducted comparative experiments on a ground-truth dataset and applied PonziGuard to Ethereum Mainnet. The results show that PonziGuard outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches and is also effective in open environments. Using PonziGuard, we have identified 805 Ponzi contracts on Ethereum Mainnet, which have resulted in an estimated economic loss of 281,700 Ether or approximately $500 million USD.",

However, since developers are not necessarily cryptography experts, requiring them to directly interact with these basic APIs has caused real-world security issues and potential usability challenges. To guide future research and solutions to these challenges, we conduct the first empirical study on Ethereum cryptographic practices. Through the analysis of 91,484,856 Ethereum transactions, 500 crypto-related contracts, and 483 StackExchange posts, we provide the first in-depth look at cryptographic tasks developers need to accomplish and identify five categories of obstacles they encounter. Furthermore, we conduct an online survey with 78 smart contract practitioners to explore their perspectives on these obstacles and elicit the underlying reasons. We find that more than half of practitioners face more challenges in cryptographic tasks compared to general business logic in smart contracts. Their feedback highlights the gap between low-level cryptographic APIs and high-level tasks they need to accomplish, emphasizing the need for improved cryptographic APIs, task-based templates, and effective assistance tools. Based on these findings, we provide practical implications for further improvements and outline future research directions.",

        "abstract": "In software development, developers extensively utilize third-party libraries to avoid implementing existing functionalities. When a new third-party library vulnerability is disclosed, project maintainers need to determine whether their projects are affected by the vulnerability, which requires developers to invest substantial effort in assessment. However, existing tools face a series of issues: static analysis tools produce false alarms, dynamic analysis tools require existing tests and test generation tools have low success rates when facing complex vulnerabilities. Vulnerability exploits, as code snippets provided for reproducing vulnerabilities after disclosure, contain a wealth of vulnerability-related information. This study proposes a new method based on vulnerability exploits, called Vesta (Vulnerability Exploit-based Software Testing Auto-Generator), which provides vulnerability exploit tests as the basis for developers to decide whether to update dependencies. Vesta extends the search-based test generation methods by adding a migration step, ensuring the similarity between the generated test and the vulnerability exploit, which increases the likelihood of detecting potential library vulnerabilities in a project. We perform experiments on 30 vulnerabilities disclosed in the past five years, involving 60 vulnerability-project pairs, and compare the experimental results with the baseline method, Transfer. The success rate of Vesta is 71.7% which is a 53.4% improvement over Transfer in the effectiveness of verifying exploitable vulnerabilities.",

Security patches provide the necessary measures to protect software from attacks and vulnerabilities. In practice, it is difficult to identify whether patches have been integrated into software, especially if we only have binary files. Therefore, the ability to test whether a patch is applied to the target binary, a.k.a. patch presence test, is crucial for practitioners. However, it is challenging to obtain accurate semantic information from patches, which could lead to incorrect results. In this paper, we propose a new patch presence test framework named Ppt4j (Patch Presence Test forJava Binaries). Ppt4j is designed for open-source Java libraries. It takes Java binaries (i.e. bytecode files) as input, extracts semantic information from patches, and uses feature-based techniques to identify patch lines in the binaries. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach Ppt4j, we construct a dataset with binaries that include 110 vulnerabilities. The results show that Ppt4j achieves an F1 score of 98.5% with reasonable efficiency, improving the baseline by 14.2%. Furthermore, we conduct an in-the-wild evaluation of Ppt4j on JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA. The results suggest that a third-party library included in the software is not patched for two CVEs, and we have reported this potential security problem to the vendor.",

Then the retrieved code is used to further enhance the performance of language models on code suggestions. We conduct experiments by integrating different language models into our framework and compare the results with their original models. We find that our framework noticeably improves the performance of both code completion and code generation by up to 53.8% and 130.8% in terms of BLEU-4, respectively.

However, the support for the following assessment of the de-tected SVs has not yet been explored. SV assessment characterizes the detected SVs to prioritize limited remediation resources on the critical ones. To fill this gap, we aim to enable early vulnerability assessment based on SV-related issue reports (SIR). Besides, we observe the following concerns of the existing assessment techniques: 1) the assessment output lacks rationale and practical value; 2) the associations between Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) metrics have been ignored; 3) insufficient evaluation sce-narios and metrics. We address these concerns to enhance the prac-ticality of our proposed early vulnerability assessment approach (namely proEVA). Specifically, based on the observation of strong associations between CVSS metrics, we propose a prompt-based model to exploit such relations for CVSS metrics prediction. More-over, we design a curriculum-learning (CL) schedule to guide the model better learn such hidden associations during training. Aside from the standard classification metrics adopted in existing works, we propose two severity-aware metrics to provide a more compre-hensive evaluation regarding the prioritization of the high-severe SVs. Experimental results show that proEVA significantly outper-forms the baselines in both types of metrics. We further discuss the transferability of the prediction model regarding the upgrade of the assessment system, an important yet overlooked evaluation scenario in existing works. The results verify that proEVA is more efficient and flexible in migrating to different assessment systems.",

        "abstract": "Test migration, which enables the reuse of test cases crafted with knowledge and creativity by testers across various platforms and programming languages, has exhibited effectiveness in mobile app testing. However, unit test migration at the source code level has not garnered adequate attention and exploration. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-language and cross-platform test migration methodology, named MUT, which consists of four modules: code mapping, test case filtering, test case translation, and test case adaptation. MUT initially calculates code mappings to establish associations between source and target projects, and identifies suitable unit tests for migration from the source project. Then, MUT's code translation component generates a syntax tree by parsing the code to be migrated and progressively converts each node in the tree, ultima tely generating the target tests, which are compiled and executed in the target project. Moreover, we develop a web tool to assist developers in test migration. The effectiveness of our approach has been validated on five prevalent functional domain projects within the open-source community. We migrate a total of 550 unit tests and submitted pull requests to augment test code in the target projects on GitHub. By the time of this paper submission, 253 of these tests have already been merged into the projects (including 197 unit tests in the Luliyucoordinate-LeetCode project and 56 unit tests in the Rangerlee-HtmlParser project). Through running these tests, we identify 5 bugs, and 2 functional defects, and submitted corresponding issues to the project. The evaluation substantiates that MUT's test migration is both viable and beneficial across programming languages and different projects.",

        "abstract": "Reentrancy, a notorious vulnerability in smart contracts, has led to millions of dollars in financial loss. However, current smart contract vulnerability detection tools suffer from a high false positive rate in identifying contracts with reentrancy vulnerabilities. Moreover, only a small portion of the detected reentrant contracts can actually be exploited by hackers, making these tools less effective in securing the Ethereum ecosystem in practice. In this paper, we propose BlockWatchdog, a tool that focuses on detecting reentrancy vulnerabilities by identifying attacker contracts. These attacker contracts are deployed by hackers to exploit vulnerable contracts automatically. By focusing on attacker contracts, BlockWatchdog effectively detects truly exploitable reentrancy vulnerabilities by identifying reentrant call flow. Additionally, BlockWatchdog is capable of detecting new types of reentrancy vulnerabilities caused by poor designs when using ERC tokens or user-defined interfaces, which cannot be detected by current rulebased tools. We implement BlockWatchdog using cross-contract static dataflow techniques based on attack logic obtained from an empirical study that analyzes attacker contracts from 281 attack incidents. BlockWatchdog is evaluated on 421,889 Ethereum contract bytecodes and identifies 113 attacker contracts that target 159 victim contracts, leading to the theft of Ether and tokens valued at approximately 908.6 million USD. Notably, only 18 of the identified 159 victim contracts can be reported by current reentrancy detection tools.",

        "abstract": "Code idioms are commonly used patterns, techniques, or practices that aid in solving particular problems or specific tasks across multiple software projects. They can improve code quality, performance, and maintainability, and also promote program standardization and reuse across projects. However, identifying code idioms is significantly challenging, as existing studies have still suffered from three main limitations. First, it is difficult to recognize idioms that span non-contiguous code lines. Second, identifying idioms with intricate data flow and code structures can be challenging. More-over, they only extract dataset-specific idioms, so common idioms or well-established code/design patterns that are rarely found in datasets cannot be identified. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach, named Idiomine, to automatically extract generic and specific idioms from both Java projects and libraries. We perform program analysis on Java functions to transform them into concise PDGs, for integrating the data flow and control flow of code fragments. We then develop a novel chain structure, Data-driven Control Chain (DCC), to extract sub-idioms that possess contiguous semantic meanings from PDGs. After that, we utilize GraphCodeBERT to generate code embeddings of these sub-idioms and perform density-based clustering to obtain frequent sub-idioms. We use heuristic rules to identify interrelated sub-idioms among the frequent ones. Finally, we employ ChatGPT to synthesize interrelated sub-idioms into potential code idioms and infer real idioms from them. We conduct well-designed experiments and a user study to evaluate Idiomine's correctness and the practical value of the extracted idioms. Our experimental results show that Idiomine effectively extracts more idioms with better performance in most metrics. We compare our approach with Haggis and ChatGPT, Idiomine outperforms them by 22.8% and 35.5% in Idiom Set Precision (ISP) and by 9.7% and 22.9% in Idiom...",

        "abstract": "During software development, vulnerabilities have posed a significant threat to users. Patches are the most effective way to combat vulnerabilities. In a large-scale software system, testing the presence of a security patch in every affected binary is crucial to ensure system security. Identifying whether a binary has been patched for a known vulnerability is challenging, as there may only be small differences between patched and vulnerable versions. Existing approaches mainly focus on detecting patches that are compiled in the same compiler options. However, it is common for developers to compile programs with very different compiler options in different situations, which causes inaccuracy for existing methods. In this paper, we propose a new approach named\nP\nS\n3\n, referring to precise patch presence test based on semantic-level symbolic signature.\nP\nS\n3\nexploits symbolic emulation to extract signatures that are stable under different compiler options.

        "abstract": "Bugs in smart contracts may have devastating effects as they tend to cause financial loss. According to a recent study, accounting bugs are the most common kind of bugs in smart contracts that are beyond automated tools during pre-deployment auditing. The reason lies in that these bugs are usually in the core business logic and hence contract-specific. They are analogous to functional bugs in traditional software, which are largely beyond automated bug finding tools whose effectiveness hinges on uniform and machine checkable characteristics of bugs. It was also reported that accounting bugs are the second-most difficult to find through manual auditing, due to the need of understanding underlying business models. We observe that a large part of business logic in smart contracts can be modeled by a few primitive operations like those in a bank, such as deposit, withdraw, loan, and pay-off, or by their combinations. The properties of these operations can be clearly defined and checked by an abstract type system that models high-order information such as token units, scaling factors, and financial types. We hence develop a novel type propagation and checking system with the aim of identifying accounting bugs. Our evaluation on a large set of 57 existing accounting bugs in 29 real-world projects shows that 58% of the accounting bugs are type errors. Our system catches 87.9% of these type errors. In addition, applying our technique to auditing a large project in a very recent auditing contest has yielded the identification of 6 zero-day accounting bugs with 4 leading to direct fund loss",

        "abstract": "In decentralized finance (DeFi), lenders can offer flash loans to bor-rowers, i.e., loans that are only valid within a blockchain transaction and must be repaid with fees by the end of that transaction. Unlike normal loans, flash loans allow borrowers to borrow large assets without upfront collaterals deposits. Malicious adversaries use flash loans to gather large assets to exploit vulnerable DeFi protocols. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for automated syn-thesis of adversarial transactions that exploit DeFi protocols using flash loans. To bypass the complexity of a DeFi protocol, we propose a new technique to approximate the DeFi protocol functional behaviors using numerical methods (polynomial approximation and nearest-neighbor interpolation). We then construct an optimization query using the approximated functions of the DeFi protocol to find an adversarial attack constituted of a sequence of functions invocations with optimal parameters that gives the maximum profit. To improve the accuracy of the approximation, we propose a novel counterexample driven approximation refinement technique. We implement our framework in a tool named FlashSyn. We evaluate FlashSyn on 16 DeFi protocols that were victims to flash loan attacks and 2 DeFi protocols from Damn Vulnerable DeFi challenges. FlashSyn automatically synthesizes an adversarial attack for 16 of the 18 benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in finding possible flash loan attacks.",

        "abstract": "As an essential component in Ethereum and other blockchains, token assets have been interacted with by diverse smart contracts. Effective permission policies of smart contracts must prevent token assets from being manipulated by unauthorized adversaries. Recent efforts have studied the accessibility of privileged functions or state variables to unauthorized users. However, little attention is paid to how publicly accessible functions of smart contracts can be manipulated by adversaries to steal users' digital assets. This attack is mainly caused by the permission re-delegation (PRD) vulnerability. In this work, we propose PRETTYSMART, a bytecode-level Permission re-delegation vulnerability detector for Smart contracts. Our study begins with an empirical study on 0.43 million open- source smart contracts, revealing that five types of widely-used permission constraints dominate 98% of the studied contracts. Accordingly, we propose a mechanism to infer these permission constraints, as well as an algorithm to identify constraints that can be bypassed by unauthorized adversaries. Based on the identification of permission constraints, we propose to detect whether adversaries could manipulate the privileged token management functionalities of smart contracts. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Prettysmart, which achieves the highest precision score and detects 118 new PRD vulnerabilities.",

Empirical results show that OVer can successfully analyze all 10 benchmarks collected, which encompass a diverse range of DeFi protocols.

However, the challenge of optimizing these networks for security and efficiency has spotlighted the need for innovative solutions, with Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques showing untapped potential. While RL's application in other domains is well-documented, its integration into ZTNs for enhanced security and efficiency remains underexplored. Our study investigates the application of RL in ZTNs, identifying models that significantly improve network adaptability and performance against cyber threats. Through a detailed review and classification of RL strategies, we found specific models that enhance ZTN security and efficiency. Our analysis provides insights into the operation mechanisms and impacts of these models, offering a comparative analysis of their effectiveness. This exploration underscores RL's potential in fortifying ZTNs, suggesting a paradigm shift in cybersecurity optimization and setting the stage for further research on the integration of AI and machine learning in enhancing network resilience.",

        "abstract": "Digitalization and sustainability stand out among the most critical mega-trends of the 21st century. The intersection of these two forces offers exciting opportunities to tackle global challenges, foster the creation of an equitable and ecologically sound society, and establish the foundation for realizing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Although they hold strategic importance, digital and sustainable transformations are frequently approached independently. This separation is due, in part, to the intricate and multifaceted nature of the relationship between digitalization and sustainability. An in-depth examination of various research outcomes highlights four primary areas in which sustainability and digitalization converge: Energy, Governance, Systems, and Innovation. The Governance domain is further elaborated in the context of planning and policy-making themes. Energy considerations encompass emissions, consumption, and production. Innovation is closely linked with business strategies, values, and environmental concerns. Lastly, systems are intricately connected with networks, Industry 4.0, and supply chain dynamics. These findings aim to provide insights and inspire further research and discussions on the potential interplay between sustainability and digitalization.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, DIY security system technologies have become more accessible for the general public. This coincided with the emergence of brands like Ring, Blink, Wyze, SimpliSafe, and Vivint, which specialized in smart home security. These brands offer a range of products, including front-door cameras, infrared motion sensors/ detectors, and in-home cameras providing various views of the house. One notable drawback of these product ecosystems is their reliance on a proprietary mobile application and a smartphone capable of running it. If the application ceased to receive support or the company went out of business, the associated hardware might no longer function as intended, resulting in unnecessary e-waste and unsustainable security practices. The proposed system design addressed the dependency on proprietary software by utilizing flexible software design within a modular motion detection security system. The proposed design entails an ecosystem that could be customized to meet specific user requirements and specifications. It was designed with sustainability in mind, capable of being thoroughly customized to different tools and services.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, the proportion of traffic incidents is on the increase due to the rapid growth of vehicles, making it a per-sistent problem. Consequently, the number of amicable accident reports is unmeasurable. An effective management of accident information is a crucial element, especially in the absence of an information system for amicable accident report management. However, the use of traditional centralized systems is critical, as long as they fail to present secure, transparent, reliable, and trustworthy platforms for accident's report management. This paper provides an innovative solution. It's a use case study of developing a Blockchain and interplanetary file system (IPFS) protocol-based system for traffic report management, using a mobile application. This application could be used at the time of the traffic accident. By using the application, road users can fill out the accident report at the same time as the accident while maintaining data authenticity, integrity, and reliability, and without the need for a third trusted party. Furthermore, the application reflects the safety performance of insurance companies and allows them to put an end to oversights, inaccuracies, or incorrect information when completing the amicable accident report. A better understanding and streamlining the process of handling accident reports is an essential component to enhance emergency response, promote road safety, and mitigate the economic impacts of traffic incidents, for both users and insurance companies.",

To solve the problem issue, propose a quasi-sensitive identification of blockchain security using tried-and-true partition fold padding encryption (PFPE) to improve the security of healthcare transactions. The Q-Pragmatic-Sensitive Feature Analysis (QPSFA) determines the terms related to sensitive privacy features. Finally, the Provable Fold Padding Encryption, and the authentication procedure is completed by using an Access Verification-based role to verify it.

Numerous Ethereum blockchain-based private solutions are available to facilitate organ donation and transplantation administration; nevertheless, their scalability, accuracy, and authenticity are limited, despite their substantial flexibility. The suggested web platform for managing organ donations, powered by Python, is intended to provide an easy-to-use and safe interface that will expedite and simplify the organ donation procedure. The platform prioritizes user verification and offers unique features for donors, recipients, and administrators. Users can create accounts and manage comprehensive profiles that include personal data, medical histories, and donation preferences. To maximize the likelihood of successful organ transplants, a sophisticated matching system that uses algorithms to match possible donors with recipients based on compatibility parameters including organ type, location, and urgency is essential to its operation. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed organ donation model, the python driven-model performance parameter are overlaid on the Blockchain-driven performance parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model offers better Scalability, Accuracy, Authentication with significant Flexibility. Further, the proposed python-Driven model achieves approximately 8% and 10% improvements in Accuracy and Scalability respectively against the existing model.",

Shared logistics is based on the concept of platform resource integration and service sharing, with services provided by third parties. Users can integrate and share goods, funds, information and other resources through online platforms according to their needs. In this mode, the logistics distribution center undertakes functions such as goods distribution and information collection. Therefore, this article focused on the problem of selecting logistics distribution nodes under the shared logistics model. A multi-objective optimization model was designed, with different weight values set for each parameter in each objective function. A logistics distribution node location algorithm based on blockchain technology was explored using blockchain technology. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm in solving the model was verified through experiments. The experimental study found that the algorithm based on blockchain technology had a high number of Pareto frontier solutions within the selected range, up to 27, which was 12 times higher than traditional site selection.",

To address these challenges, a proposed model introduces a unique approach to bolstering the security and efficiency of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in healthcare through the use of advanced cryptographic techniques. Specifically, the model utilizes a heavy computation algorithm known as Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) for packet verification in IoT devices. In addition to ECC, the model incorporates Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) for verification, providing a lighter alternative to ECC. ZKP works by signing the input messages and subsequently verifying the data, offering a robust security measure. The implementation strategy involves simulating IoT sensors, each equipped with ECC and Zero Knowledge proof capabilities for enhanced security.",

Those authentication schemes not relying on passwords are built by using cryptography protocols so as to achieve high security levels. However, their efficacy relies on the confidentiality of cryptographic keys and has limitations when implemented on resource-constrained devices. This paper introduces a novel approach to devise an authentication scheme without relying on the storage of keys in device memory and without the presence of a centralised entity. We develop a lightweight mutual authentication scheme utilizing Static Random Access Memory (SRAM)-Physical Unclonable Function (PUF), which leverage on the inherent randomness of SRAM obtained during its manufacturing process to create keys. The proposed solution is further fortified by blockchain technology that is used to provide a decentralised management authority.

Due to this complex process and waiting time, the public tends to go through middlemen and third-party agents, which sometimes leads to fraud. This paper provides a detailed review and limitations of the current land registry system, both paper-oriented and centralized online system, as well as a review of current research on blockchain-based land registry processes. To make the land registry system more secure and faster than the available solutions, this proposes a modified solution that will mitigate the limitations of the related work by using a three-tier structure, including a government body responsible for taking permission and overlooking the entire transaction, a buyer or seller, and further banks responsible for overlooking payment transactions. The three parties approve the transaction, and then the transaction details are added to the Ethereum blockchain network. The solution also solves the transaction size issue by storing the meta data on the main chain and non-transactional data on the IPFS network, which will significantly reduce the load on the network.",

        "abstract": "As social media grows to entangle and remould the lives of people, so grows the concern over data privacy, censorship, server outages, and control over personal information by proprietary bodies due to their centralized design. The rise of blockchain has encouraged researchers to consider the decentralization framework for developing online social networks to resolve the challenges mentioned above. In a decentralized ecosystem, no one entity has absolute access to data and the power to enforce arbitrary decisions. The benefits of this include ownership over personal data, censorship resistance, data security, and improved control over user-generated content. In this paper, we propose the design of Ethnos, a social networking application built to harness the powers of blockchain and distributed storage technology to heighten the security and reliability of users as well as their data. In that context, suitable smart contracts have been fabricated. This paper also prospects integration of two-factor user authentication and trust score checks with Ethnos to corroborate the trustworthiness of both user and data. In addition, Ethnos incorporates a remuneration system to compensate users for their contribution to and engagement with the platform.",

        "abstract": "For patients, accurate and comprehensive medical records are an incredible asset. During medical services, privacy protection and the integrity of sensitive medical information are critical concerns. Blockchain technology, renowned for its immutable and decentralized nature, presents a promising solution to safeguarding these critical records. This research paper delves into the patient perspective concerning the utilization of blockchain to fortify healthcare document security. In addition, the blockchain\u2019s properties were assessed concerning the healthcare supply chain using the Task Technology Fit (TTF) framework and the Fit-Viability Model (FVM). An empirical study of 296 customers/patients and healthcare professionals from medical sector shall evaluate fit and viability of blockchain technology adoption for storage and protection of medical records. The Fit and Viability framework was analyzed implementing structural equation modelling to access the adoption of blockchain technology in medical sector. Research findings indicate that task-technology fit, and environment technology fit significantly influenced functional benefits and symbolic benefits respectively. Further function benefits and viability had significant positive impact on BCT adoption. However Symbolic benefits were found to be insignificant for BCT adoption. In conclusion, this research advocates for a paradigm shift in healthcare document security, emphasizing patient empowerment and trust through blockchain technology. By centering on patient perspectives, concerns, and preferences, this paper advocates for the adoption of blockchain solutions having a significant impact due to functional benefits that not only fortify document security but also prioritize consumers/patient\u2019s confidence and participation in their healthcare journey.",

        "abstract": "Cervical cancer is a serious health concern that entails high risks for individuals due to delayed detection and treatment worldwide. Formal screening for the condition is challenging in both developed and developing countries due to a number of factors, including medical costs, access to healthcare facilities, social norms, and delayed symptom manifestation. Bypassing conventional, time-consuming medical procedures, machine learning presents a promising path for the efficient and economical early diagnosis of a variety of diseases, including cervical cancer. However, the fact that existing machine classification techniques for identifying diseases rely heavily on the predictive accuracy of a single classifier poses a significant drawback. Single classification methods alone might not provide the best predictions because of bias, over-fitting, improper handling of noisy data, and outliers, among other issues. Moreover, machine learning algorithms deals with sensitive patient data therefore Security measures are necessary to prevent unauthorized access and safeguard individual and organisations\u2019 privacy, guard against model tampering. This paper proposes a novel framework for cervical cancer automated prediction using ensemble model training and blockchain smart contracts. The research records a noteworthy improvement in prediction test accuracy of 99.7% and train accuracy of 93%, surpassing the accuracy of predictions made by individual categorization techniques.",

        "abstract": "The digital world has expanded because of Covid-19. Also, the impact of demonetization on the expansion of digital transactions can vary based on several factors, including the readiness of the digital infrastructure, the level of financial inclusion, and the overall economic landscape of a country. However earlier all users have depended on physical transaction but after covid and other reasons the many users are not interested to do same tasks manually. Instead of that it required to do the transactions in online platforms. For example, e-fund transfers, digital wallets, mobile payments etc. In this regards it can see one thing that network size was increased. As the network expands, the risk of attacks seeking sensitive user information, like login credentials and credit card details, rises. With many users relying on credit cards for online transactions, safeguarding login credentials becomes crucial to prevent unauthorized access during transactions. Based on research gaps it can say that a new and secure credit card storage system will be useful for e-commerce. In most cases, sensitive and classified data or information is presented in unencrypted formats to remote machines resulting in unauthorized access and disclosure. This proposed work has explained with 2-stage mechanism in which one stage at banker side and other at e-commerce side. The first stage performed with tokenization (with XOR operation) and AES cryptosystem. In second stage, providing security by using two factor authentication of generating secret pin along with OTP. After completion of implementation, every credit card holder data has encrypted along with their transaction.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a blockchain and AI-based methodology to prevent drug counterfeiting within the supply Chain. Incidents of counterfeit medicines, particularly in densely populated developing nations like India, have the potential to spiral into major disasters. This paper examines the effect of counterfeit medicine impacting the health & life of countless individuals. Additionally, it could also result in substantial financial and reputational repercussions for both governmental bodies and pharmaceutical companies. Thorough research and detailed investigation have shown substantial advantages to using blockchain technology over traditional systems. The traditional client-server centralized systems face significant complications concerning security and traceability. In contrast, the proposed blockchain-based architecture assures transparency and open-ness within the medicine supply chain. The architecture takes advantage by leveraging blockchain technology with respect to decentralization, tamper-proofing, and Traceability. Each product registered on the blockchain possesses a QR code for detailed information retrieval and ownership history, aiding in identifying counterfeit origins. Furthermore, each product also comes with authenticated certificates and lab reports. These reports are verified by drug administration authorities to strengthen the reliability of the product. As a result, developed system offers robust measures against counterfeit origins as compared to traditional and other blockchain based systems.",

Ransomware has variants, and the attackers keep changing the nature of these variants. This review paper studies the complex background of these two threats and scrutinizes the actual challenges, and problems that the banking industry and financial institutions face. These threats, though distinct in nature, share commonalities, such as financial motivations and sophisticated techniques. We focus on examining the newly emerged variants of ransomware while we provide a comprehensive idea of cryptojacking and its nature. This paper involves a detailed breakdown of the specific threats posed by cryptojacking and ransomware. It explores the techniques cybercriminals use, the variabilities they look for, and the potential consequences for financial institutions and their customers. This paper also finds out how cybercriminals change their techniques following the security upgrades, and why financial firms including banks need to be proactive about cyber threats. Additionally, this paper reviews the background study of some existing papers, finds the research gaps that need to be addressed, and provides suggestions including a conclusion and future scope on those disputes. Lastly, we introduce a Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) approach for up-to-date cyber threat hunting processes for minimizing both cryptojacking and ransomware attacks in the banking industry.",

        "abstract": "Digital land registration plays a pivotal role in modernizing and securing land ownership records. Issues with traditional land registration processes include slowness, fraud, and a lack of openness. The conventional land registration system, which is still in use in many nations, has several problems, including corruption, integrity issues, and inaccurate data. Document discrepancies resulting from data errors discovered during the land registration procedure give rise to ownership rights disputes. One use case involves several middleman and central institutions is land registration, which boosts trust and confidence in the system. By eliminating intermediaries and centralized organizations, land registration will be quicker. It is challenging to keep track of who owns what land when hundreds or even thousands of land records need to be kept up to date. A straightforward decentralized land registration application was created using the Ethereum Blockchain. This technology allows the transaction process to have just two clients (buyer, seller) and to be visible at all times. This paper presents a novel approach to digital land registration using blockchain technology and smart contracts. The research looks at these technologies\u2019 intricacies and speculates on how they might totally change the process of registering land. This paper offers a thorough examination of existing state of affairs and potential obstacles with regard to the integration of blockchain technology and smart contracts into land registration increases efficiency and computational costs thus by enhancing digitizing land records by improving trust and transparency.",

        "abstract": "Patient care has certainly enriched by implementing digitalization in healthcare. This digital transformation has posed obstacles with data security and privacy. By the introduction of e-health, huge volumes of sensitive and classified data is digitally processed and the likelihood of numerous personal health records (PHR) rules infractions or breaches has drastically increased by implementation of digitalization. Even with the advancement in technologies, it will take due time before a system development can effectively address the security issues and give patients, who are the natural guardians of their health data a total control over their personal data. Hence, there is an urgent need for a patient-centric system that maintains data privacy and gives patients a total control over their PHR. To redefine E-Health security, the cutting-edge technologies comprising of Distributed Hash Table (DHT), Blockchain, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), and Inter Planetary File solution (IPFS) needs integration. IPFS and DHT enables in improving Data privacy by providing a reliable and effective decentralized and distributed storage solution. Enabling safe access control over this information, a Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT) leverages the transparent and unchangeable characteristics of Blockchain. The idea of SSI, which gives patients control over their digital identities and to manage their E-Health data, is fundamental to this paradigm. This study advocates for the widespread implementation of patient-powered electronic health record management system.

In this paper we look for the present cloud provenance and their security modulations which work with the blockchain network. The main work of this paper is how provenance is categorized, what is the need, why it is needed, how it is described, and way to publicize it. This paper also analyzes the challenges facing provenance anthology and a variety of models used to overcome them. The ideal outcome of the paper is tamper-proof records can be obtained using the provenance concept merged with blockchain technology. Cloud storage is used to collect different form of provenance records. A DPAEBS-Chain (Data Provenance- Attribute enabled blockchain service) chain is designed and which will validate the records available in cloud and embeds into blockchain storage of transactions enhances the reliability with low overhead, user privacy and tamper-proof provenance with high security measures.",

        "abstract": "The use of information technology to trade information, deliver services, and other things is becoming more and more commonplace in the era of technological advancement. Tendering is one such area where the public and private sectors collaborate. E-tendering is a procurement technique that uses the internet and digital technologies to automate and simplify the whole bidding or tendering process. This makes it easier for the bidders to browse through all of the open tenders and select one to proceed with. But it frequently results in a number of challenges that both bids and bidders must deal with. The system is inefficient because of scale and transparency problems brought on by its centralized architecture. Additionally, the system frequently shares information about tenders with other outside organizations, which compromises the confidentiality and integrity of the tenders. To manage these issues, a decentralized method is used in the deployment of the Blockchain e-tendering system. Consequently, the procurement procedures will have the opportunity to leverage the potential of blockchain technology to enhance security and transparency. This research aims to provide an electronic tendering system that is transparent, liquidate, and safe. It will manage tender allocation and use smart contracts to automate the underlying processes with the least amount of human interaction possible.",

        "abstract": "The Agri-Connect2.0 technology set up a problem with the farming business workshop. This weakness is shown by how hard it's for growers to sell their crops at prices that are allowed to be fair. In order to break this problem, our group came up with the idea for the Agri-Connect PWA app, which is a web operation that makes life easy for growers. Our PWA, which is called Agri-Connect, gives growers the freedom to decide how important they want to charge for their recently gathered goods. growers are more likely to get the plutocrat they earn from the trade of their goods if they do not pay commissions to mediators and rather make direct connections with guests. Also, the original portion shops, which are also used to store the particulars, help with the distribution of ranch goods and with getting those goods to where they need to go. Within each portion shop, there are separate doors for managing orders and storing information about guests and growers. All of these spots are translated with blockchain technology to make sure they work and are open to everyone. Our Progressive Web operation(PWA) works well with WhatsApp, so growers can now partake information about their crops and talk to buyers through an easy-to-use point. This was possible because our PWA was linked to WhatsApp. Because of this, it's easier for growers to vend their goods. Our thing is to close the gap between husbandry and technology so that growers can have further control over their businesses and make further plutocrats. We plan to do this by taking advantage of how numerous people use WhatsApp and how easy it's to use. It's a one-of-a-kind result that was made to change the agrarian business and give growers more fair ways to vend their goods. This exact answer is called Agri-Connect PWA.",

        "abstract": "Integration of biometric authentication, dynamic CVV, and Machine Learning Model Having the capacity to enhance the security of financial transaction systems. The recommended method is to employ biometric identifying techniques, such fingerprint scanning, for user authentication. Before transmitting the transaction data via JSON to a backend API, the recommended method encrypts it. To find any possible suspicious activity, it is advised to evaluate transaction data using a machine learning model that is part of the backend API. It is advised to steer clear of any transaction that the machine learning algorithm flags as fraudulent. In the event that the machine learning model finds no evidence of fraudulent activity, processing the transaction is the advised course of action. Installing a dynamic CVV system is one technique to potentially increase security. By creating a new CVV for each transaction completed using this approach, fraudsters would find it far more difficult to reuse stolen card data. One proposed fix for the system is blockchain technology, which would provide a safe and transparent ledger to store records of every transaction. By strengthening transaction record security, the recommended fix would make it more difficult for fraudsters to modify or alter them.",

These needs include a wide range of topics, including performance, safety, efficiency, scalability, and even compatibility. Once the theoretical principles and hardware requirements are fully understood, the technique moves on to the design step. Key to realizing these abstract ideas is the development of specialized hardware architectures and components. Based on the outcomes of the performance assessment, iterative refinement is carried out to fix the hardware's flaws and enhance its functionality. As a result of this iterative process, hardware is kept up to date to suit the ever-shifting requirements of Web3.0 and edge intelligence.

        "abstract": "Social media networks have become an essential part of the modern world, with billions of people using them as an integral part of their daily lives. Despite their popularity, these networks are centralized, allowing the companies that own them to monitor and track their users' activities. This has given rise to serious concerns regarding the privacy and security of user data, which are often sold to third parties for profit. Given the massive value of user data in today's and tomorrow's world, many people are concerned about this issue. While decentralized, community-driven applications have emerged as a potential solution to this problem, none have yet been able to compete with centralized social network platforms. Due to those facts, this research aimed to propose a decentralized social network architecture that would incorporate the basic functionalities of a social media platform while ensuring the privacy and security of users' data, which would be stored locally on their devices. A thorough study of the existing centralized and decentralized social media platforms was conducted to identify the path for this research. The proposed protocol offers a decentralized and secure social media platform architecture that provides true ownership of user data along with decentralized data integrity and caching.",

        "abstract": "Today, cyber assaults are common, therefore industrial communication systems need strong protection. This study presents a comprehensive method to improve cyberattack resilience. It has three main algorithms. These algorithms identify hazards before they happen, react quickly, and provide adaptive system security. Due to their mathematical roots, these algorithms can make exact conclusions now. Potential Hazard Identification and Classification The first technique extracts features from raw data and organises them into feature vectors. Assigning an anomaly score to every data point allows instantaneous hazard detection. This tool uses anomaly detection to find unusual computer system and network activity. Emergency Response and The second algorithm calculates incident response time based on risk. It gives rapid, efficient replies based on severity, reducing hazards as they emerge. To assure safety in changing surroundings The third algorithm updates the system's security settings to reflect threat environment changes. It assesses danger and modifies security measures accordingly. The proposed strategy outperforms established methods in several performance evaluation criteria. It improves accuracy and precision while maintaining recall rates equal to competitors, making it a dependable and durable solution for protecting industrial communication systems from changing cyber threats.",
