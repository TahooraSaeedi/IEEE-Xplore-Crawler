        "abstract": "Blockchain is an emerging technology that has the potential to revolutionize the global industry and create a trusted relationship in a multi-party business network. There are a number of practical use cases where blockchain has been applied. One specific area is the Art industry, where it is a natural fit in the way that art forensics and transactions are conducted, tracked and recorded. This motivates us to develop the ArtChain platform to assist the Art Industry. In this paper, we present ArtChain, which is an integrated trading system based on blockchain. It includes the front end, the back end, the services, the smart contract, the chain connection and the deployment scripts from the bottom to the top. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deployed blockchain-enabled art trading platform in Australia. It provides a transparent yet privacy-preserving, and tamper-proof transaction history for registration, provenance, and traceability of art assets. Our objective analysis and evaluation show that the ArtChain platform is applicable and practical. For the interest of other researchers, our system implementation related resources are open-sourced on Github.",

        "abstract": "Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a popular protocol used in Blockchain systems to resolve double-spending problems. However, if an attacker has access to calculation hash power greater than half of the total hash power, this attacker can create a double-spending attack or 51% attack. The cost of creating a 51% attack is surprisingly low if hash power is abundantly available. That posts a great threat to lots of PoW blockchains. We propose a technique to combine history weighted information of miners with the total calculation difficulty to alleviate the 51% attack problem. Analysis indicates that with the new technique, the cost of a traditional attack is increased by two orders of magnitude.",

This leads to high operating cost when deploying these relays between Ethereum-based blockchains where validating block headers on-chain is computationally expensive.To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel relay scheme that employs a validation-on-demand pattern combined with economic incentives to reduce the cost of operating a relay between Ethereum-based blockchains by up to 92%. With this relay scheme, decentralized interoperability between blockchains like Ethereum and Ethereum Classic becomes feasible.",

        "abstract": "Witnessing the increasingly pervasive deployment of security video surveillance systems(VSS), more and more individuals have become concerned with the issues of privacy violations. While the majority of the public have a favorable view of surveillance in terms of crime deterrence, individuals do not accept the invasive monitoring of their private life. To date, however, there is not a lightweight and secure privacy-preserving solution for video surveillance systems. The recent success of blockchain (BC) technologies and their applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) shed a light on this challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight, Blockchain-based Privacy protection (Lib-Pri) scheme for surveillance cameras at the edge. It enables the VSS to perform surveillance without compromising the privacy of people captured in the videos. The Lib-Pri system transforms the deployed VSS into a system that functions as a federated blockchain network capable of carrying out integrity checking, blurring keys management, feature sharing, and video access sanctioning. The policy-based enforcement of privacy measures is carried out at the edge devices for real-time video analytics without cluttering the network.",

In particular, the performance of the Hyperledger Fabric platform is evaluated in terms of: (a) throughput, i.e., successful transactions per second; (b) latency, i.e., response time per transaction in seconds; and (c) scalability, i.e., number of participants serviceable by the platform. The results indicate that the instance of Hyperledger Fabric platform being implemented can support up to 100,000 participants on the selected AWS EC2 instance. As long as the transaction rate is maintained within 200 transactions per seconds, the network latency is in the order of fraction of a second.",

        "abstract": "At an era of new emerging technologies, and spotting lights to blockchain technology specifically; many promises take place. Blockchain has attracted many researchers and practitioners from various professions and disciplines, due to the powerful characteristics behind adopting such technology. And in order to formulate a better understanding of it, many researchers are interested in classifying the Blockchain-Based Software Systems (BBSSs). Unfortunately, none of the available taxonomies in the literature considers the various Software Engineering (SWE) aspects for building a BBSS. A blockchain subject matter expert (SME) may absorb a specific aspect understanding from each of the related taxonomies, and in order to have a complete understanding of the various options available for building a BBSS, they will have to flip from a resource to another in order to collect the scattered information they need. So, this paper aims to assist the blockchain SMEs to articulate a comprehensive understanding of the various and most recent concepts and design decisions available, in order to implement or propose a BBSS solution. The taxonomy is derived from the fundamental knowledge and the major SWE aspects which a BBSS implementer or researcher has to consider, and thus is not biased to a specific SWE aspect.",

This article attempts to propose a security evaluation model for blockchain software and hardware fusion devices based on decision tree algorithms. From the perspective of blockchain technology architecture, it fully reveals the security risks of evaluated blockchain projects for software and hardware fusion devices. It is necessary to conduct a comprehensive analysis of various technologies that affect the security risks of blockchain software and hardware fusion devices. By reusing the kernel through decision tree algorithm, a system chip that meets predetermined requirements can be quickly constructed, integrating processor modules and some commonly used functional modules. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the experimental group model is consistently higher than that of the traditional model. During the detection rate process, the average value of the experimental group is as high as 89.3%, which is much higher than the traditional model. Furthermore, the error detection rate curve remains at the lowest position, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation model.",

However, because of the limited throughput, current blockchain platforms can not meet the transaction demand in practical use. Though researchers proposed many new solutions, they suffered either decentralization or security issues. In this paper, using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, we improve the linear structure of traditional blockchain protocol. In the new structure, blocks are organized in levels and width, which will generate into a compacted DAG structure (CoDAG). To make CoDAG more efficient and secure, we design algorithms and protocols to place the new-generated blocks appropriately. Compared with traditional blockchain protocols, CoDAG improves the security and transaction verification time, and enjoys the consistency and liveness properties of blockchain. Taking adversary parties into consideration, two possible attack strategies are presented in this paper, and we further prove that CoDAG is a secure and robust protocol to resist them. The experimental results show that CoDAG can achieve 394 transactions per second, which is 56 times of Bitcoin's throughput and 26 times of Ethereum's.",

Unfortunately, some inherent limitations of blockchain have been rarely addressed by the most existing works when applying blockchain into crowdsourcing, which becomes the performance bottleneck of crowdsourcing systems. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid blockchain crowdsourcing platform to achieve decentralization and privacy preservation. Our platform integrates with a hybrid blockchain structure, dual-ledgers, and dual consensus algorithms to ensure secure communication between the requesters and the workers. Moreover, the smart contract and zero-knowledge proof are employed to ensure automatic operation of the tasks and the protection users' privacy, respectively. Finally, we conduct experiments to confirm the efficiency of the adopted consensus algorithm on our platform by comparing it with the state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "Energy storage units (ESUs) enable several attractive features of modern smart grids such as enhanced grid resilience, effective demand response, and reduced bills. However, uncoordinated charging of ESUs stresses the power system and can lead to a blackout. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain and smart contracts to build a decentralized charging coordination mechanism without the need for a centralized charging coordinator. First ESUs should use tokens for anonymously authenticate themselves to the blockchain. Then each ESU sends a charging request that contains its State-of-Charge (SoC), Time-to-complete-charge (TCC) and amount of required charging to the smart contract address on the blockchain. The smart contract will then run the charging coordination mechanism in a self-executed manner such that ESUs with the highest priorities are charged in the present time slot while charging requests of lower priority ESUs are deferred to future time slots. In this way, each ESU can make sure that charging schedules are computed correctly. Finally, we have implemented the proposed mechanism on the Ethereum test-bed blockchain, and our analysis shows that execution cost can be acceptable in terms of gas consumption while enabling decentralized charging coordination with increased transparency, reliability, and privacy preserving.",

To achieve this, the data in the blockchain storage have to be transformed into blockchain knowledge. We refer to these types of blockchains as knowledge-based blockchains. Knowledge-based blockchains are potentially useful in building efficient risk assessment applications. An earlier work introduced probabilistic blockchain which facilitates knowledge-based blockchains. This paper proposes an extension for the probabilistic blockchain concept. The design of a reputation management framework, suitable for such blockchains, is proposed. The framework has been developed to suit the requirements of a wide range of applications. In particular, we apply it to the detection of malicious nodes and reduce their effect on the probabilistic blockchains' consensus process. We evaluate the framework by comparing it to a baseline using several adversarial strategies. Further, we analyze the collaborative decisions with and without the malicious node detection. Both results show a sustainable performance, where the proposed work outperforms others and achieves excellent results.",

        "abstract": "The fast developing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies provide a promising opportunity to build large-scale systems to connect numerous heterogeneous devices into the Internet. Most existing IIoT infrastructures are based on a centralized architecture, which is easier for management but cannot effectively support immutable and verifiable services among multiple parties. Blockchain technology provides many desired features for large-scale IIoT infrastructures, such as decentralization, trustworthiness, trackability, and immutability. This paper presents a blockchain-based IIoT architecture to support immutable and verifiable services. However, when applying blockchain technology to the IIoT infrastructure, the required storage space posts a grant challenge to resource-constrained IIoT infrastructures. To address the storage issue, this paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain storage structure, ChainSplitter. Specially, the proposed architecture features a hierarchical storage structure where the majority of the blockchain is stored in the clouds, while the most recent blocks are stored in the overlay network of the individual IIoT networks. The proposed architecture seamlessly binds local IIoT networks, the blockchain overlay network, and the cloud infrastructure together through two connectors, the blockchain connector and the cloud connector, to construct the hierarchical blockchain storage. The blockchain connector in the overlay network builds blocks in blockchain from data generated in IIoT networks, and the cloud connector resolves the blockchain synchronization issues between the overlay network and the clouds. We also provide a case study to show the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical blockchain storage in a practical Industrial IoT case.",

        "abstract": "Today's blockchain landscape is severely fragmented as more and more heterogeneous blockchain platforms have been developed in recent years. These blockchain platforms are not able to interact with each other or with the outside world since only little emphasis is placed on the interoperability between them. Already proposed solutions for blockchain interoperability such as naive relay or oracle solutions are usually not broadly applicable since they are either too expensive to operate or very resource-intensive. For that reason, we propose a blockchain interoperability oracle that follows a voting-based approach based on threshold signatures. The oracle nodes generate a distributed private key to execute an off-chain aggregation mechanism to collectively respond to requests. Compared to state-of-the-art relay schemes, our approach does not incur any ongoing costs and since the on-chain component only needs to verify a single signature, we can achieve remarkable cost savings compared to conventional oracle solutions.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain is a popular topic of research in recent years. For worthwhile research into the use Blockchains, they often must be deployed into environments that are as close to real-world scenarios as possible. Real-world networks are large and complex and therefore the Blockchains used to research them should be large and complex. Creating large Blockchains like this may seem out-of-reach for the humble researcher. The tool introduced in this paper - Containerchain - seeks to make it much easier to spin up a large Blockchain system with little-or-no setup. The ultimate goal being to allow researchers to spend more time on actual research, rather than on setting up the network. Containerchain allows the user to deploy a real Blockchain system (not simulated) with several configurable parameters at their disposal. The user can control the number of nodes in the system, the consensus mechanism used and can observe and analyze the network traffic in the Blockchain - which is recorded out-of-the-box.",

We envision a marketplace for IoT data streams that can unlock such potential value in a scalable way, by enabling any pairs of data providers and consumers to engage in data exchange transactions without any prior assumption of mutual trust. We present a marketplace model and architecture to support trading of streaming data, from the advertising of data assets to the stipulation of legally binding trading agreements, to their fulfilment and payment settlement. Crucially, we show that by using blockchain technology and Smart Contracts in particular, we can offer participants a trade-off between the cost of transactional data exchange, and the risk of data loss when trading with untrusted third parties. We experimentally assess such trade-offs on a testbed using Ethereum Smart Contracts.",

As the adoption of blockchain technologies by various sectors increases, there is a demand for tools that enable regulatory enforcement, which include monitoring, examining and ensuring compliance of the data stored by the blockchain systems, all in a privacy preserving way. Current blockchain solutions store transactions in append-only and immutable fashion without any indexing, which contributes to limited and inefficient queries. Additionally, there is no support for privacy-preserving query processing. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a system that can provide auditors, enforcing regulatory compliance, with efficient, scalable and richer blockchain query processing over Hadoop and synchronized Ethereum clients. The system additionally ensures auditors' privacy by utilizing cryptography techniques over semi-trusted servers to protect the auditors' identities, queries and their results.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain applications require metadata to be associated with the blockchain ledger. Metadata is often stored in centralized cloud servers, which limits the decentralization of the blockchain. Alternatively, metadata can be integrated into distributed storage systems to achieve full decentralization of blockchain networks. However, evaluating the performance of distributed storage systems is often neglected. To address this gap, we present a framework that includes a set of technical indicators. We specifically focus on the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as an illustrative distributed storage system and provide a practical use case to demonstrate the application of our framework.",

It is important to ensure the trustworthiness of the heterogeneous IoT data. To address this requirement, the data provenance needs to be used in the IoT system. In this article, we integrate the PROV-DM model into the IoT architecture and propose an IoT data provenance model. To avoid corrupting and forging the provenance information, we record the provenance data onto the blockchain. In addition, we use the IoT secure and computable data sharing system to illustrate that the proposed model can construct a provenance graph to detect which agent operates the IoT data abnormally. Finally, we implement and evaluate the proposed model on a public IoT database.",

Efforts are being made to reduce carbon footprint to mitigate such effects. Calculating the carbon footprint of food products is complex and requires the cooperation of all the stakeholders of the food supply chain. A record keeping system for tracking carbon footprint while preserving privacy for the related parties is needed. This paper presents a new implementation of blockchain for tracking of carbon footprint on food production and transportation stages. We designed a system that tracks the carbon footprint of food processing facilities and transportation parties using cluster-based record keeping while preserving their privacy. We implemented the proposed carbon footprint chain and evaluated its throughput and latency under different scenarios. We show that our blockchain implementation is capable of operating with a larger number of nodes without any scalability issues.",

        "abstract": "With the acceleration of the digital transformation of the power system, the electronic data in the power production operation has shown an explosive growth. However, the increasing proliferation of deep forgery technology has brought huge hidden dangers to the electronic data management of power grid enterprises, and it is urgent to build a trusted management system for electronic data. This paper proposes a blockchain-based deep forgery data identification and traceability framework. Firstly, a method of trusted identification of electronic data based on blockchain is proposed, which constructs the unique identification of data and embeds it in the electronic data as a digital watermark. Second, introduce blockchain-based electronic data forensic appraisal technology to conduct authenticity and similarity analysis of electronic data. Finally, a deep forgery data traceability mechanism based on digital identification is designed to realize deep forgery data traceability and dissemination supervision. After comparative analysis, the framework is more secure and efficient in deep forgery data supervision, and can provide key support for building a trusted content system in cyberspace.",

        "abstract": "Many variants of (delegated) Proof-of-Stake blockchains have been introduced since 2016, among which Cardano, Algorand, and Tezos have been more widely adopted. Each of these blockchains has attempted to address the scalability and consumption issues of Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains from different angles. However, the economic incentives of these blockchains have raised the concern about the decentralisation level of key players, such as validators, and stakeholders, in those \u201cexpected to be decentralised\u201d networks. In this work, we conduct an analysis of Cardano's activity and wealth concentration. For the first time, we perform a clustering of the addresses that belong to the same wallet based on existing heuristics for UTXO-like blockchains. Moreover, an analysis of reward distribution on Cardano is presented. The analysis results of this work disclose objective insights into the Cardano blockchain, including the rewards distribution, stake balance distribution, and wealth concentration.",

        "abstract": "5G technology's rapid development revolutionized the field of cellular networks by providing higher data rate up to 10 Gbit/s using millimetre waves. Though 5G network can carry huge data with a higher speed than 4G, it can cover only a shorter province, around 1000 feet which is not even 2% of 4G's coverage. Numerous 5G cell towers and antennas are required to ensure reliable 5G signal and connectivity. This resulted in frequent and increased authentication when User Equipment (UE) moves between cells. Therefore, there is a critical need for a fast and frequent authentication mechanism. Though existing 4G authentication protocols can be adopted for 5G, they can only satisfy the basic requirements on the security front but cannot handle frequent authentications effectively. Blockchain technology with the features such as security, anonymity, immutability and transparency has been considered a promising technology to evade redundant authentications. Therefore, an effective and secure authentication scheme by completely utilizing features of Blockchain technology has been proposed in this paper. The proposed methodology works in two steps, the first by the introduction of a novel optimized authentication specific consensus algorithm for improving the Authentication Rate. Second, the reduction of the authentication by utilizing the authentication results stored in UE-AP Blockchain aiming to handle the redundant authentications.",

        "abstract": "The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is a distributed file system that seeks to decentralize the web and to make it faster and more efficient. It incorporates well-known technologies, including BitTorrent and Git, to create a swarm of computing systems that share information. Since its introduction in 2016, IPFS has seen great improvements and adoption from both individuals and enterprise organizations. Its distributed network allows users to share files and information across the globe. IPFS works well with large files that may consume or require large bandwidth to upload and/or download over the Internet. The rapid adoption of this distributed file system is in part because IPFS is designed to operate on top of different protocols, such as FTP and HTTP. However, there are underpinning concerns relating to security and access control, for example lack of traceability on how the files are accessed. The aim of this paper is to complement IPFS with blockchain technology, by proposing a new approach (BlockIPFS) to create a clear audit trail. BlockIPFS allows us to achieve improved trustworthiness of the data and authorship protection, and provide a clear route to trace back all activities associated with a given file using blockchain as a service.",

However, Traditional centralized storage cannot meet performance and security requirements and fully distributed storage consumes a large amount of computing, storage and network resources, which is inefficient and difficult to implement. In this paper, we propose a clustering strategy on node community clustering by constructing a trust model based on the decentralization of blockchain technology. We introduce a multi-chain storage structure. Our experiments show that the proposed strategy reduces data synchronization time and storage space, improves system performance by enabling efficient parallel processing.",

Our research shows that most design decisions are influenced by the need to offset current blockchain drawbacks such as scalability, privacy, and usability by using centralized elements. This suggests that a hybrid architecture is beneficial in many design situations.",

Accountability is a desirable property of distributed systems that enables the detection, identification, and removal of faulty or malicious behavior. It is a complementary approach to Byzantine fault tolerance, which is concerned with ensuring continued functioning of the system in the presence of Byzantine faults. Our proof of concept consists of a Raspberry Pi acting as a human interface; the blockchain is implemented in Hyperledger Fabric and the Raspberry Pi runs a lightweight blockchain client to minimize computational burden. The application shows that we are able to use smart contracts to detect and identify faulty or malicious hardware, and the permissioning framework to remove it.",

However, the traditional loyalty program has problems such as inability to interact across platforms and lack of credibility. The points alliance is an effective measure to solve the above problems. By formulating the corresponding points exchange agreement within the alliance, the barriers of data interaction between different platforms can be broken. Blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization and distribution, which is consistent with the technical needs of the points alliance. Based on the research of decentralized exchange, this paper designs a blockchain-based points trading mechanism, and explains the details of points trading and the implementation of order matching. The mechanism proposed in this paper helps to increase the probability of successful exchange of points, thus increasing the use value of loyalty points.",

Existing centralized data sharing and access systems provide less transparency and traceability as the users have to trust a centralized authority and its decision making for the entire system. There is a need for decentralized distributed data storage and access without a central authority. Blockchain provides promising solutions to such needs. However, the existing decentralized blockchain-based solutions are complex and involve financial incentives, which limits their applications. We propose a secure permissioned blockchain-based decentralized system, VAULT, with a novel quorum-based consensus. We store encrypted files using Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and the references to the files in the blockchain. VAULT is designed for applications involving collaboration from multiple permissioned parties, and users can store, access, and share data as well as manage projects through blockchain. Our experimental results show that our quorum selection is fair, and the VAULT protocol is scalable.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain is a distributed shared ledger and database. Because of its unforgeable, traceable, open, and transparent, and collective maintenance features, it has laid a solid foundation of \u201ctrust\u201d. At the same time, the blockchain also brings hidden dangers of data security. How to protect the data security of digital currency in blockchain transactions is the direction of this article. This article first analyzes the basic structure of the blockchain, and then takes Bitcoin in the digital currency as an example to introduce its technical principles and implementation process. Finally, the PBFT algorithm is proposed, which can search for the application of encryption in the blockchain consensus mechanism. The experimental data verification proves the future application prospects of blockchain-based digital currency using PBFT algorithm to protect data security.",

        "abstract": "Both the number of blockchains and the discovered number of applications of blockchain are ever-increasing. Understanding how different blockchains compare in performance has become more important than ever, yet each blockchian paper uses its own inconsistent standards for performance analysis. There are few mechanisms that may allow for consistent performance analysis among multiple blockchains. This paper details the implementation of the first-ever multi-layer blockchain parameter tuning system: Parameter Space Exploration. Our system is primarily targeted at the performance issue but also takes into consideration power consumption. Multi-layer blockchains use a permissioned blockchain to solve performance deficits. We find that the side chain is the determining factor for the performance of a multi-layer system; our side chain is chosen among a set of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and Crash Fault Tolerance (CFT) based consensus algorithms as they are more energy-efficient and have higher performance than their Proof of Work (PoW) counterparts. Our proposed Parameter Space Exploration has two elements: (1) The concept of a parameter space; (2) A side-by-side benchmarking system for balanced comparison among different multi-layer blockchains and consensus algorithms.",

Networks based on Proof-of-Authority (PoA) and compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) are particularly advantageous in this scenario, providing both efficiency and straightforward setup. While private blockchains inherently enhance security by their permissioned nature, which restricts node participation to authorised entities only, it\u2019s crucial to recognise the ongoing necessity for additional safeguards. These safeguards are essential to guarantee that only verified and trustworthy smart contracts are deployed. A key concern in this realm is addressing particular attack vectors, such as front-running attacks.

        "abstract": "Nowadays, the rise in popularity of massive open online courses (MOOCs) is significant. However, current online education service heavily relies on a third-party platform, which acts as a middleman to process transactions occurred among system participants. On the one hand, this centralized business model is based on database management system, once compromised, the data consistency and safety of transaction records can no longer be guaranteed. On the other hand, it's more expensive to resolve disputes and possible fraud transactions via a mediator than a direct peer-to-peer trusted payment. Aiming at solving issues regarding security and inefficiencies, we propose a crypto-asset EduCoin which is designed for secure and efficient payment in MOOC environment. Specially, we present a multi-party business model based on permissioned blockchain, Composer smart contracts and network topologies that utilize the three-tiered functional architecture of Fabric to achieve fast payment and trusted audit. By leveraging benchmark tools Caliper and Hitchhiker, we develop typical workloads based on transaction scenarios applying EduCoin. The experimental results demonstrate the practicality of EduCoin and offer insights into the design trade-offs and performance bottlenecks in production. We have released EduCoin for public use.",

Tokens define chunks of data on a blockchain, allowing it to be distributed like virtual currency. However, storing all data related to digital assets in a token is difficult. Data is currently managed separately because storing a large amount of data in a blockchain can cause the ledger to grow large. When the management of data depends on a particular organization, the stability of the token's value depends on that particular organization. In this paper, we propose an organization-independent management method that combines a distributed content-addressable file system with a blockchain. Our proposed method places the data associated with the token and the access information to the token into the distributed content-addressable file system. As a result, the token associated with the data has the sharing control of the data stored in the distributed content-addressable file system, and a configuration independent of the specific contract is realized.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain has recently emerged as an important tool that can enable critical distributed applications without requiring centralized trust. For example, public blockchains have been used to enable many different cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, existing public blockchains and smart contracts deployed on them may disclose sensitive information. Although there is some ongoing work that leverage advanced cryptography to address some of these sensitive information leakage issues, they require significant changes to existing and popular blockchains such as Ethereum and are usually computationally expensive. On the other hand, private blockchains have been proposed to allow more efficient and privacy-preserving data sharing among pre-approved group of nodes/participants. Although private blockchains address some of the privacy challenges by allowing sensitive data to be only seen by the select group of participants, they do not allow public accountability of transactions since transactions are approved by known set of users, and cannot be accessed publicly. Given these observations, one natural question that arise is, can we leverage both public and private blockchain infrastructures to enable efficient, privacy enhancing and accountable applications? In this work, we try to address this challenge in the context of digital auctions. Mainly, we propose a novel hybrid blockchain architecture that combines private and public blockchains to allow sensitive bids to be opened on a private blockchain so that only the auctioneer can learn the bids, and no one else. At the same time, we leverage public blockchains to make the auction winner announcement, and payments accountable. Furthermore, using smart contracts deployed on public blockchain, we show how to incentivize truthful behavior among the auction participants. Our extensive empirical results show that this architecture is more efficient in terms of run time and monetary cost compared to pure public blockchain based aucti...",

As factories move towards smart development, the existing network security systems can no longer meet the needs of enterprises and users. Aiming at the hidden dangers of information leakage and illegal access to the data of cryptographic production facilities and products in the smart factory, the article combines the core technology of the Internet of Things radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and blockchain technology, and proposes a blockchain-based technology, the lightweight password security authentication mechanism of the smart factory RFID system, which has the characteristics of lightweight, anti-data leakage, and low management cost. It can ensure the safe and reliable access of industrial data while preventing the application of RFID in smart factories. Security issues such as replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and server spoofing attacks also provide new ideas for the research on data security protection for smart factories.",

        "abstract": "While there are many data collection and analysis tools for Ethereum - the largest smart contract blockchain by market capitalization, development of similar tools for other smart contract blockchains is lacking. Reasons for this are non-existent standards, changing specifications d ue t o rapid development, common usage of the off-chain storage, and lack of developers. One of such blockchains is Polkadot - a layer- zero blockchain featuring a single relay chain whose role is to secure smart contract transactions on multiple other parachains. In this paper we describe a data collection pipeline for Polkadot blockchain that we then use to perform an analysis of the bow-tie structure of its transfer network over time, with special emphasis on the role of nominators and validators in this structure. We find evidence that t he Polkadot ecosystem iss lowly maturing from a system dominated by nominators and validators, both of which require some technical skill as well as willingness to bond sufficient amount of funds, into a system increasingly populated by regular users using the financial services of Polkadot.",

However, as with any new technology, adoption of blockchain carries with it, as yet not widely known, risks that should be properly evaluated and understood prior to design and development. Given the purely distributed nature of blockchain, in which nodes can span continents, a key aspect in planning and designing blockchain systems which is not readily incorporated in a modern architect\u2019s vernacular is consideration of eventual consistency, system stability and scalability when designing blockchain based systems. This is compounded by the fact that, as yet, very few practical tools are available to help architects better understand and plan for the above. In this paper we introduce BlockSIM, a comprehensive and open source blockchain system simulation tool which can assist blockchain architects better evaluate the performance of planned private blockchain networks by running scenarios and decide the optimal system parameters suited for their purposes. We compare the results of our simulation with real blockchain networks and demonstrate that BlockSIM can be used effectively by architects of blockchain systems to plan and implement scalable, stable and resilient blockchain networks. Finally, we demonstrate via a real life example how architects can apply BlockSIM to plan and design real-world blockchain systems.",

Combining the blockchain with access control can solve the problems such as single point of failure and opaque authority judgment in traditional centralized access control systems. The access control system of the system pays more attention to the framework design, ignoring the influence of the uncertainty of the entity's behavior after authentication on the blockchain network. Based on this, we propose a distributed access control system based on blockchain. Based on the ABAC model, the policy decision point, policy management point, and attribute authority are completed through smart contracts deployed by nodes in the blockchain network. The main function. The experimental results show that the scheme is feasible and effective, realizes decentralization, transparent authority judgment, and supports dynamic and fine-grained access control system.",

However, several challenges such as low processing speed, scalability, and vulnerability to certain attacks have been identified, making it difficult to apply the technology on general industrial applications. In this paper, we propose a new application service platform architecture on top of blockchain that resolves those challenges. The proposed architecture takes advantage of private blockchain to secure processing speed and security while allowing public open use of the system by dividing the system into multiple layers. Assuming arbitrary nodes can participate in service, we propose periodic node verification process and `query-chain' to effectively authenticate and validate arbitrary nodes.",

To be more specific, we design and implement Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) in a permissioned blockchain called Hyperledger Fabric and leverage its smartcontract and distributed consensus to enable a distributed access control for IoT.

        "abstract": "A neural key exchange is a secret key exchange technique based on neural synchronization of the neural network. Since the neural key exchange is based on synchronizing weights within the neural network structure, the security of the algorithm does not depend on the attacker's computational capabilities. However, due to the neural key exchange's repetitive mutual-learning processes, using explicit user authentication methods -such as a public key certificate- is inefficient due to high communication overhead. Implicit authentication based on information that only authorized users know can significantly reduce overhead in communications. However, there was a lack of realistic methods to distribute secret information for authentication among authorized users. In this paper, we propose the concept idea of distributing shared secret values for implicit authentication based on the randomness of the public blockchain. Moreover, we present a method to prevent the unintentional disclosure of shared secret values to third parties in the network due to the transparency of the blockchain.",

        "abstract": "In permissioned blockchains, a set of identifiable miners are in charge of consolidating the new blocks. The agreement protocol is usually based on a consensus mechanism inspired by a voting Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) mechanism rather than the well-known proof-of-work (PoW). However, PoW provides some benefits with respect to BFT, i.e., it allows the final user to quantify the effort required to change a consolidated transaction without the need of trusting the consortium of miners. In this paper, we address some of the problems that arise from the application of PoW in permissioned blockchains. In fact, in standard PoW, it may be easy for one miner to temporary reach 50% of the total hash power and since mining rewards are usually not expected, the problem of balancing the efforts of the miner becomes crucial. We propose a simple solution based on a sliding window algorithm to address these problems and analyse its effectiveness in terms of security. Additionally, we propose a quantitative model whose solution allows us to assess its capacity of balancing the hash power provided by heterogeneous miners.",

Blockchain (BC) has many technical characteristics, such as decentralization, impossibility of being tampered with and forged, which makes it have incomparable advantages in ensuring information credibility, security, traceability and other aspects of traditional technology. In this paper, a method of constructing PKI certificate system based on permissioned BC is proposed. The problems of multi-CA mutual trust, poor certificate configuration efficiency and single point failure in digital certificate system are solved by using the characteristics of BC distribution and non-tampering. At the same time, in order to solve the problem of identity privacy on BC, this paper proposes a privacy-aware PKI system based on permissioned BCs. This system is an anonymous digital certificate publishing scheme., which achieves the separation of user registration and authorization, and has the characteristics of anonymity and conditional traceability, so as to realize to protect user's identity privacy. The system meets the requirements of certificate security and anonymity, reduces the cost of CA construction, operation and maintenance in traditional PKI technology, and improves the efficiency of certificate application and configuration.",

        "abstract": "Industrial procurement processes are inefficient, expensive, and error-prone as they require the agreement of numerous participants, audit-proof documentation, and are characterized by a high number of manual tasks. Blockchain technology has the potential to counter these challenges by combining peer-to-peer networks, cryptography, and consensus algorithms. A blockchain is a decentralized database that stores transactions and data transparently, chronologically, and tamper-proof in a distributed network. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based industrial marketplace, where machines have an identity and account for selecting, ordering, and paying materials in an automated manner using smart contracts. This allows manufacturers with a low real-net-output-ratio, such as car manufacturers that depend on numerous suppliers, to optimize their purchasing processes. Using our case study, we demonstrate prototypical implementation of the decentralized marketplace and its applications in the area of industrial maintenance. Furthermore, we conducted a semi-structured interview with procurement and information technology experts from the automotive industry. The results indicate that our prototype offers a promising approach streamlining procurement processes within the next two to five years.",

        "abstract": "As large-scale construction projects become increasingly complex, the use and integration of advanced technologies are being emphasized more and more. However, the construction industry often lags behind most industries in the application of digital technologies. In recent years, a decentralized, peer-to-peer blockchain technology has attracted widespread attention from academia and industry. This paper provides a solution that combines blockchain technology with construction project fund management. The system involves participants such as the owner's unit, construction companies, government departments, banks, etc., adopting the technical architecture of the \u201cXiong'an Blockchain Underlying System\u201d. The core business and key logic processing are all implemented through smart contracts, ensuring the transparency and traceability of the fund payment process. The goal of ensuring investment quality, standardizing investment behavior, and strengthening cost control is achieved through blockchain technology. The application of this system in the management of Xiong'an construction projects has verified that blockchain technology plays a significant positive role in strengthening fund management, enhancing fund supervision, and ensuring fund safety in the construction process of engineering projects. It helps to eliminate the common problems of multi-party trust and transparent supervision in the industry and can further improve the investment benefits of government investment projects and improve the management system and operation mechanism of investment projects.",

Such data include the amount of waste collected for each category from a citizen. By using a blockchain storing data related to collected waste, maximum data integrity and transparency would be ensured. Furthermore, citizens are provided with a smartphone app to read data from the blockchain, register other data concerning their activities, and check their fee balance.

        "abstract": "The tourism industry is a new sector that stimulates consumer spending and drives economic growth, with the internet providing effective measures for its rapid development. Traditional online tourism service platforms, managed by a single entity, face trust barriers between different industries, hindering further development in tourism. The open and transparent nature of blockchain can effectively solve trust issues. However, existing solutions lack a study on the business processes of tourism services. The tourism industry still facing challenges such as cumbersome business processes, low coordination efficiency among stakeholders, and difficulties in service execution monitoring. Based on the above issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based tourism service level agreement execution framework to establish a tourism service level agreement (TSLA) between tourists and service providers to realize the service provider's commitment to tourists. Furthermore, this paper designs a Tourism Service Level Agreement Smart Contract (TSLA-SC) based on oracle technology, stores the service execution process on the blockchain, tracks potential malicious behaviors of service providers, and sets corresponding reward and punishment measures to automate the TSLA execution process. Finally, experiments are conducted to test the cost and time expenses of TSLA-SC, with results indicating that the proposed solution can operate at lower costs, demonstrating good usability in terms of cost overhead.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose MACS - a new coin selection algorithm for multi-asset UTXO-based blockchains. MACS addresses the primary coin selection requirements regarding transaction fee, transaction size, UTXO pool size, transaction age, and privacy. We compare the performance of MACS with other coin selection algorithms. The performance evaluation shows that MACS achieves the mentioned requirements while outperforming other coin selection algorithms in terms of having a wider distribution of their number of UTXO inputs. Moreover, UTXOs will not remain in the UTXO pool forever when the MACS algorithm is used since MACS keeps the fraction of old UTXOs oscillating between\n0%\nand\n20%\n.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) bears unprecedented security and scalability challenges due to the magnitude of data produced and exchanged by IoT devices and platforms. Some of those challenges are currently being addressed by coupling IoT applications with blockchains. However, current blockchain-backed IoT systems simply use the blockchain to store access control policies, thereby underutilizing the power of blockchain technology. In this paper, we propose a new framework named Sash that couples IoT platforms with blockchain that provides a number of advantages compared to state of the art. In Sash, the blockchain is used to store access control policies and take access control decisions. Therefore, both changes to policies and access requests are correctly enforced and publicly auditable. Further, we devise a \"data marketplace\" by leveraging the ability of blockchains to handle financial transaction and providing \"by design\" remuneration to data producers. Finally, we exploit a special flavor of identity-based encryption to cater for cryptography-enforced access control while minimizing the overhead to distribute decryption keys. We prototype Sash by using the FIWARE open source IoT platform and the Hyperledger Fabric framework as the blockchain back-end. We also evaluate the performance of our prototype and show that it incurs tolerable overhead in realistic deployment settings.",

        "abstract": "Although Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to attract attention, the inaccurate pricing of Bitcoin options has resulted in an inefficient crypto derivative market. In this paper, we adopt a multiple input LSTM-based prediction model in conjunction with the Black-Scholes (BS) model to address this challenge in Bitcoin option pricing. We discuss the relationship between on/off-chain transactions and predict the implied price volatility of the next 30 days, which is the main factor in the BS model. First, we analyze the Blockchain statistics and social network trends of Bitcoin as inputs to our model, including the liveness of Blockchain wallet, the scale of active Blockchain nodes and the impact factor of Google, Reddit, Twitter to name a few. Next, we implement the LSTM-based prediction model and evaluate it in various historical window sizes and network parameters. Finally, we compare the performance with the baseline model without Blockchain statistics inputs. The experimental results show that the proposed multi-input LSTM-based prediction model provides the risk-informed pricing of the Bitcoin call options and our Blockchain statistics reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by up to 46.2%.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain technology has positively impacted traceability across various industries such as logistics and shipping. By overcoming the problem of data silos among organizations and concentration of authority, this innovative approach allows a decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger to be built. On the other hand, the use of non-fungible tokens, a new concept for projecting digital and physical goods on a blockchain, is expected to be able to represent complicated operations in traceability systems. However, the existing token design lacks an efficient model for retrieval of past histories. The most popular way to retrieve past information on tokens is to use blockchain explorers, which are centralized trusted parties. Otherwise, so far there is only a naive way to examine all block headers, and it takes a vast amount of time. Our preliminary study shows that the processing time for retrieving all histories of 1,030 tokens on the Ethereum mainnet takes approximately 57 minutes. We propose a new token design based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that allows token histories to be efficiently explored without examining the whole blockchain. The model associates each state of the token from past to latest and covers expressions of relationships between tokens, such as merge and split. Our implementation and evaluation reveal that the DAG-based token design significantly improves the efficiency of exploring token transfer histories. The results show that our method can complete the exploration for 1,030 tokens in a matter of seconds and maintains performance over the long term even if the blockchain grows.",

The potential of the blockchain technology cannot be fully realized unless it is made more scalable. We extend previous analysis on a fundamental trade-off between the throughput and forking rate of the blockchain system. We further propose FastChain to increase the throughput of the blockchain system by reducing the block propagation time. FastChain adopts bandwidth-informed neighbor selection. Miners disconnect from bandwidth-limited neighbors and favor the nodes with higher bandwidth. We build a Blockchain Dynamics Simulator (BDSim) to evaluate the performance of FastChain. FastChain improves the throughput by 20%~40% in the normal operations.",

Since their inception, several innovative projects have been proposing solutions to the blockchain trilemma, improving blockchain features and its technical limitations. However, the adoption of blockchain as a technology or a software component, requires a comprehensive understanding and characterization of their technical principles and characteristics. The latter introduces an uncertainty for an organization to decide which blockchain protocol best meets its needs and demands. In general, there is a lack of proper testing and software engineering practices for assessing the usage of blockchains usage and understanding their performance. Towards that direction, this paper presents an architecture for a blockchain benchmarking framework which aims at the deployment and evaluation of different blockchain protocols, focusing on different aspects such as security and scalability. A set of modules is introduced for testing and evaluating the behaviour of blockchain protocols under different test scenarios.",

        "abstract": "The increase in cyberattacks against the healthcare system, notably Electronic Health Records (EHRs) breaches, has cost the healthcare providers more in recent years. This situation is estimated to increase in the coming years as the healthcare systems are proposing a consortium EHRs repository. In an attempt to secure these health records, researchers propose firewalls, cryptography, cloud antivirus. Although these approaches proved useful and practical in protecting EHRs; however, the shared data security cannot be guaranteed. More specifically, maintaining the integrity and consistency of shared EHRs becomes a significant concern. In this on-going research, we propose a blockchain-based solution that facilitates a scalable and secured inter-healthcare EHRs exchange. These healthcare providers maintain their records on separate blockchain networks and are independent of each other. The proposed architecture can detect and prevent malicious activities on both EHRs at rest and in transit. It can also verify the integrity and consistency of EHR requests and replies from other healthcare systems and presents them in a format that can be easily understood by different healthcare nodes. We evaluate the security analysis against frequently encounter outsider and insider threats within a healthcare system in the preliminary result. The result shows that the architecture detects and prevents insider threats from uploading compromising EHRs into the blockchain and prevents unauthorized retrieval of patient information.",

        "abstract": "Microgrid research and construction effectively use distributed energy resources to stimulate clean energy devel-opment. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading in microgrids helps create a fully competitive and autonomous energy trading market. Blockchain technology is employed to realize a P2P energy trading framework. However, while public blockchain is generally transparent, energy trading information is sensitive and thus requires a privacy-preserving mechanism. In this paper, we design a privacy-preserving energy trading mechanism by using blockchain and zero-knowledge proofs. A user uploads a commitment to the blockchain instead of the original bid amount, and the zero-knowledge proof of commitment is uploaded into the blockchain. Other participants can verify the correctness of energy trading in each auction match. Our experiments show the design is feasible and efficient in Ethereum although there are more gas consumptions.",

This trilemma claims that it is impossible to simultaneously achieve the three properties of decentralization, scalability, and security in a blockchain. While extensive analysis of blockchain performance has been conducted, the claim has been empirically accepted as true. However, no one has formulated this trilemma mathematically. In this paper, we present a formula that explicitly expresses the trilemma for Proof of Work blockchains. Furthermore, based on our mathematical representation of the trilemma, we illustrate the two categories of approaches for improving blockchain performance under the constraints of the trilemma.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a demonstration of anonymous authentication on trust within a blockchain-based Mobile Crowdsourcing System (MCS). MCS has gained substantial attention from both academic and industrial sectors as an effective method for data collection. Nevertheless, traditional MCS heavily relies on third parties to maintain system operations, which may lead to single-point failures and incur serious privacy concerns. The introduction of blockchain technology offers the potential to get rid of the third-party intermediaries. However, the inherent decentralized and transparent nature of blockchain also brings in new challenges related to privacy and trust. A critical challenge in the context of blockchain-based MCS is achieving anonymous authentication on trust. Despite the typical conflict between trust evaluation and anonymity, ensuring anonymity is a crucial privacy prerequisite for MCS, while trust plays a pivotal role in various MCS activities such as task selection and truth determination. In this paper, we present a demonstration of a novel blockchain-based MCS that provides a secure and efficient crowdsourcing platform for fair and effective allocation of tasks. Notably, we leverage Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to achieve anonymous authentication within a decentralized environment. Through the implementation of a decentralized trust evaluation approach, our system enables accurate trust assessment.",

        "abstract": "Enterprise business transactions have both public and private information; hence blockchain adaptation to an enterprise business application needs current blockchain platforms to support both public and private information. Public blockchains (permissionless) are optimized for transparency; hence the sharing of private and sensitive information is challenging. On the other hand, private blockchains (permissioned) separate information about a transaction by generating a public transaction and a set of private transactions and treat them separately. This separation weakens the cohesiveness of transaction information and develops an extra burden when it is necessary to connect both public and private information which is not duly addressed in the literature. For example, auditing, regulatory activities, certifications, and traceability need both the public and private information about transactions. This paper uses semantic triples and introduces the Triples for Transactions(T4T) model to define blockchain transactions, improve cohesiveness and resolve the extra burden of connecting both private and public transactions. This paper presents a user-driven transaction analysis, transaction modelling using the T4T model, semantic querying, and REST endpoints to enrich transaction management. Sets of semantic triples can define both public and private information about a transaction while preserving cohesiveness of the information. This approach supports point-to-point sharing of sensitive information while preserving implicit relationships between both private and public information. We have implemented an auditing scenario in the proposed approach adopting Hyperledger Fabric and compared for performance with Hyperledger Fabric. The results showed that the proposed approach reduces the number of transaction cycles by 66% compared to Hyperledger Fabric and the performance of information retrieval is in O(N). This result is a significant improvement compared to Hyperledger F...",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the technologies of blockchains, the Internet of Things (IoT), etc. technologies have been drawing attention across different industries. In our experience, during a pandemic, we look for innovations and personalization of secure data sharing on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to provide better healthcare services. In the paper, we propose a decentralized record management system which is to share data over multiple independent blockchain entities. Each blockchain runs under the administration of an independent healthcare organization. In our design, data would be shared and integrated among multiple Hospital Information Systems (HIS) across different healthcare organizations. It gives doctors and healthcare personnel an easy and safe way to obtain the health records of patients across hospitals dynamically worldwide through negotiated Service-Layer Agreements (SLAs) to provide accurate medical services. Our system leverages blockchain properties to manage access authentication, retrieve medical data, and add new patient data entries. Without a centralized system and database, the design autonomously, dynamically, and securely governs the retrieval and storage of data traffic based on the SLAs. Further, we integrate the system design with the Bell-LaPadula access control model to maintain the confidentiality of security organized in a non-discretionary fashion for different layers of secrecy. Since an HIS runs within the security bounds of a healthcare authority, we can adopt the Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm, which is developed by the Go Ethereum (Geth) team. The PoA provides an efficient, low computational power consumption approach for securely validating the blockchains.",

        "abstract": "Missing interoperability is a prevalent issue in today's blockchain landscape. Due to this lack of interoperability, only smart contracts deployed on the same blockchain can call each other. Smart contract interactions across the boundaries of blockchains would, however, provide an opportunity to create cross-blockchain applications. Hence, an additional mechanism for the execution of cross-blockchain smart contract calls is desirable. Unfortunately, already proposed solutions usually require one or more trusted intermediaries, which eventually leads to a lower degree of decentralization. Therefore, we propose a novel framework to enable smart contract interoperability across different blockchains. The framework enables the execution of asynchronous cross-blockchain smart contract calls. It uses blockchain relays to maintain a high degree of decentralization while placing only minor trust in intermediaries. We provide a prototypical implementation for Ethereum-based blockchains and evaluate it regarding costs and execution time.",

While Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols mostly guarantee consistency (safety) in an asynchronous network using 3f+1 machines to overcome the simultaneous malicious failure of any f nodes, in many systems, e.g., blockchain systems, the number of available nodes (resources) is much more than 3f + 1. To utilize such extra resources, in this paper we introduce a model that leverages transaction parallelism by partitioning the nodes into clusters (partitions) and processing independent transactions on different partitions simultaneously. The model also shards the blockchain ledger, assigns different shards of the blockchain ledger to different clusters, and includes both intra-shard and cross-shard transactions. Since more than one cluster is involved in each cross-shard transaction, the ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph.",

To safe-guard security and privacy of EHR, access control is an essential mechanism for managing EHR data. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture to facilitate access control of EHR data by using both blockchain and edge node. Within the architecture, a blockchain-based controller manages identity and access control policies and serves as a tamper-proof log of access events. In addition, off-chain edge nodes store the EHR data and apply policies specified in Abbreviated Language For Authorization (ALFA) to enforce attribute-based access control on EHR data in collaboration with the blockchain-based access control logs. We evaluate the proposed hybrid architecture by utilizing Hyperledger Composer Fabric blockchain to measure the performance of executing smart contracts and ACL policies in terms of transaction processing time and response time against unauthorized data retrieval.",

        "abstract": "Loyalty Programs are reward programs offered by a company to customers who frequently make purchases. However, there are major issues with traditional loyalty programs like low redemption rates, expiring of points, customer acquisition costs, and the nuisance of keeping track of multiple loyalty programs. Blockchain provides a solution to a number of these issues. This paper explores the issues of the current loyalty programs and how Blockchain technology can be used to tackle the underlying issues of traditional loyalty programs. Finally, we propose our own Blockchain-based universal loyalty platform, which aims at making loyalty programs more beneficial for customers, thereby increasing customer retention rates as well as more convenient for companies to have their own loyalty program. This system aims to integrate individual loyalty programs into a unified platform that will allow transfer and exchange of loyalty points between users and promote co-branding among various companies located worldwide.",

In this paper, the goal is to try out the employment of blockchain in RE market and represent the facilities it can give to the RE market. The research to date leads to the following conclusions: Blockchain technology and smart contracts can sort out the classical issues that RE is facing with, and they offer much more meaningful tools for a game theoretic stable-priced market.",

A feasible solution to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions is via a mechanism that is laid out in Kyoto protocol in 1997. It was signed by close to 192 nations thus creating a system to monetize carbon emissions with an aim to build an authority over it. There have been efforts to build a system in previous decade too but there have been certain shortcomings. The major challenges which exist are data manipulation, lack of transparency and substantial costs. So we have come up with the idea of Blockchain which will build a carbon credit ecosystem thus guaranteeing us security, transparency, accessibility to the standardized carbon markets. We will also be using sensors to automate the data to out consortium.",

However, the problems of low credibility of data and mismatch between government budget and work requirements are existing in the current carbon emissions data verification business. In this paper, we proposed a blockchain-based carbon verification mechanism to address the problem of low credibility of carbon emissions data, and realized the full traceability of verification data through a data control model of \"private chain + alliance chain\". Then we designed a reverse auction algorithm based on ring signature to address the problem of mismatch between government budget and work requirements. We also use the alliance chain platform FISCO BCOS as the underlying architecture, designed the corresponding smart contract, and verify the feasibility of the system. The results are conducive to promoting the market-oriented and benign development of carbon verification business.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain has attracted considerable attention as a solution to the challenges of privacy, security and decentralisation for many applications. However, these characteristics of the blockchain result in ever growing ledger size, which is one of the major barriers to blockchain adoption in large-scale networks such as the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we propose Multi-Level Distributed Caching (MLDC) for blockchain storage optimisation which reduces data replication based on data access pattern. MLDC divides nodes into storage classes (SCs) by their node availability, and assigns each SC a different Access Frequency (AF) to remove data from the local storage. Over time, each node only stores frequently accessed data, so MLDC can reduce the total storage cost by 83% compared to conventional blockchain systems, while maintaining blockchain consistency and data availability with a slight increase in network overhead and data query delay.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain is a shared digital public ledger that cannot be changed once transactions are recorded and verified. Since most blockchain nodes retain copies of the ledger, the blockchain brings the benefits of decentralization while also bringing privacy leakage issues. With the continuous development of blockchain applications, how to protect the privacy data on the blockchain platform is a very worthwhile research question. This paper first divides each blockchain transaction data into two parts: sensitive data and basic data, and then encrypts and hides the sensitive data into the HEVC video to protect the privacy transaction data of the blockchain. The experimental results show that this HEVC video steganography algorithm can effectively increase the privacy data embedding capacity and get good visual quality.",

        "abstract": "The application of blockchain technology in the context of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has emerged as a significant and challenging area of research in recent years. Many believe that blockchain capabilities can be leveraged to comply with GDPR principles. This study focuses on the specific capabilities of blockchain technology and addresses the unique data protection challenges in the information age, aiming to identify and represent these relationships through an applicability model. The goal of this research is to present a model for evaluating and selecting blockchain applications that are aligned with GDPR requirements. This model is developed through a meta-synthesis method and qualitative content analysis of 67 articles that concentrate on the potential applications of blockchain in GDPR across various countries. These applications are defined based on an analysis of key blockchain capabilities such as transparency, immutability, and data encryption. Further, this study maps these capabilities to key GDPR requirements such as data minimization and accuracy, analyzing them from both facilitating and inhibiting perspectives. Ultimately, based on qualitative content analysis and an in-depth study of 31 articles selected through the Critical Assessment of Methods of Protein Structure Prediction method (CASP), this research offers a comprehensive model for understanding and leveraging blockchain technology in a manner that complies with GDPR requirements. according to this, the study contributes to the understanding of blockchain technology\u2019s applicability in meeting GDPR requirements, offering insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and technology developers on the strategic implementation of blockchain for data protection.",

In order to ensure the security of the video, we use data hiding technology to embed message that can ensure the security of the video into the video, at the same time, in order to improve the non-tamperability and non-forgery of data hiding. We construct the hash value of the message embedded in the original video, the hash value of the carrier video (video with embedded message) and the attribute message of the video as video metadata, and upload the video metadata to the blockchain network. Comparing the message extracted from the carrier video with the video metadata stored on the blockchain can achieve double verification of the video. At the same time, distributed storage of carrier video through IPFS can effectively store and manage large-scale video data, ensuring the security and high availability of videos.",

        "abstract": "In a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain, all nodes need to be able to recognize approximately synchronized clocks. A PoS blockchain relies on external clocks, and each node synchronizes its local clock according to an external clock using Network Time Protocol (NTP) or a similar protocol. However, this external dependence is undesirable because it reduces the autonomy, sustainability and trustless nature of the blockchain. This paper presents a clock synchronization protocol for slot-based PoS blockchains. The proposed protocol estimates the block propagation time to ensure that the synchronization is closer to that of a real-world clock. In addition, the proposed method considers the clock drift and clock adjustment frequency to achieve more accurate synchronization. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method can synchronize with a time that is closer to that of a real-world clock and with higher accuracy than existing methods.",

        "abstract": "The AEC sector is a significant component of the UK economy and is under enormous pressure to improve its environmental sustainability. Though significant progress has been achieved in reusing, remanufacturing, and recycling materials, using blockchain in the circular supply chain is still a relatively new idea and particularly challenging in the building industry. As a result, this study focuses on the importance of blockchain and circular economy in built-environment supply chains. We show the application method of utilising a blockchain-enabled digital platform and the idea of material passports to efficiently monitor materials and resources in the built environment. Based on the methodologies of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Costing (LCC), and Building Information Management (BIM), we suggest that blockchain can be used to track environmental performance (e.g. materials, energy, and carbon emissions) and value creation opportunities at each stage of the building life cycle.",

        "abstract": "Blockchain as a potentially disruptive technology can advance many different fields, e.g., cryptocurrencies, supply chains, and the industrial Internet of Things. The next-generation blockchain ecosystem is expected to consist of various homogeneous and heterogeneous distributed ledgers. These ledger systems will inevitably require a certain level of proper cooperation of multiple blockchains to enrich advanced functionalities and enhance interoperable capabilities for future applications. The interoperability among blockchains will revolutionize current blockchain design principles, like the emergence of the Internet. However, the development of cross-blockchain applications involves much complexity regarding the variety of underlying cross-blockchain communication. With that regard, we propose an efficient, interoperable blockchain architecture, InterTrust, to support interoperability and trustworthiness among arbitrary blockchain systems (including homogeneous and heterogeneous blockchains). It consists of an atomic cross-chain communication protocol, which can be considered an agnostic protocol to integrate existing blockchain systems smoothly. InterTrust is powered by two innovative techniques: threshold signature scheme and trusted hardware. The threshold signature scheme guarantees consistency and verifiability in the target blockchain systems, and the trusted hardware guarantees trusted services among distinct blockchain systems. Combining these two techniques provides an efficient cross-chain communication protocol to facilitate atomic swaps and interoperable operations between different blockchain systems. Our interoperable architecture is robust to support arbitrary blockchain systems. We also present the security analysis on the scenarios of integrating our protocol into Byzantine fault tolerance based blockchain systems.",
