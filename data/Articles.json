            "abstract": "Blockchain is an emerging technology that has the potential to revolutionize the global industry and create a trusted relationship in a multi-party business network. There are a number of practical use cases where blockchain has been applied. One specific area is the Art industry, where it is a natural fit in the way that art forensics and transactions are conducted, tracked and recorded. This motivates us to develop the ArtChain platform to assist the Art Industry. In this paper, we present ArtChain, which is an integrated trading system based on blockchain. It includes the front end, the back end, the services, the smart contract, the chain connection and the deployment scripts from the bottom to the top. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deployed blockchain-enabled art trading platform in Australia. It provides a transparent yet privacy-preserving, and tamper-proof transaction history for registration, provenance, and traceability of art assets. Our objective analysis and evaluation show that the ArtChain platform is applicable and practical. For the interest of other researchers, our system implementation related resources are open-sourced on Github.",

However, if an attacker has access to calculation hash power greater than half of the total hash power, this attacker can create a double-spending attack or 51% attack. The cost of creating a 51% attack is surprisingly low if hash power is abundantly available. That posts a great threat to lots of PoW blockchains. We propose a technique to combine history weighted information of miners with the total calculation difficulty to alleviate the 51% attack problem. Analysis indicates that with the new technique, the cost of a traditional attack is increased by two orders of magnitude.",

This leads to high operating cost when deploying these relays between Ethereum-based blockchains where validating block headers on-chain is computationally expensive.To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel relay scheme that employs a validation-on-demand pattern combined with economic incentives to reduce the cost of operating a relay between Ethereum-based blockchains by up to 92%. With this relay scheme, decentralized interoperability between blockchains like Ethereum and Ethereum Classic becomes feasible.",

            "abstract": "Witnessing the increasingly pervasive deployment of security video surveillance systems(VSS), more and more individuals have become concerned with the issues of privacy violations. While the majority of the public have a favorable view of surveillance in terms of crime deterrence, individuals do not accept the invasive monitoring of their private life. To date, however, there is not a lightweight and secure privacy-preserving solution for video surveillance systems. The recent success of blockchain (BC) technologies and their applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) shed a light on this challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight, Blockchain-based Privacy protection (Lib-Pri) scheme for surveillance cameras at the edge. It enables the VSS to perform surveillance without compromising the privacy of people captured in the videos. The Lib-Pri system transforms the deployed VSS into a system that functions as a federated blockchain network capable of carrying out integrity checking, blurring keys management, feature sharing, and video access sanctioning. The policy-based enforcement of privacy measures is carried out at the edge devices for real-time video analytics without cluttering the network.",

In particular, the performance of the Hyperledger Fabric platform is evaluated in terms of: (a) throughput, i.e., successful transactions per second; (b) latency, i.e., response time per transaction in seconds; and (c) scalability, i.e., number of participants serviceable by the platform. The results indicate that the instance of Hyperledger Fabric platform being implemented can support up to 100,000 participants on the selected AWS EC2 instance. As long as the transaction rate is maintained within 200 transactions per seconds, the network latency is in the order of fraction of a second.",

Firstly, electric power engineering project management problems, such as qualifications of contractors or subcontractors, subcontracting in breach of contract, lack of transparency in the payment of workers' wages, arrears of wages, withholding and embezzlement of contract funds, and malicious debt collection, were analysed. Then, the data deposit, enterprise and personnel credit management, contract management, project progress management, and funds management based on the blockchain technology were studied. Finally, the blockchian based electric power engineering project management system was designed.",

The virtual power plant is an important branch of the energy internet, and it plays an important role in the aggregation of distributed power generation resources and the establishment of virtual power resource transactions. However, in the existing virtual power plant model, the following problems are becoming increasingly prominent, such as safeguard, credit rating system, privacy protection, benefit distribution. Firstly, the operation and transaction mechanism of the virtual power plant was introduced. Then, the blockchain technology is introduced into the virtual power plant transaction to make it more conducive to the information transparent, stable dispatch system, data security, and storage security.

Blockchain has attracted many researchers and practitioners from various professions and disciplines, due to the powerful characteristics behind adopting such technology. And in order to formulate a better understanding of it, many researchers are interested in classifying the Blockchain-Based Software Systems (BBSSs). Unfortunately, none of the available taxonomies in the literature considers the various Software Engineering (SWE) aspects for building a BBSS. A blockchain subject matter expert (SME) may absorb a specific aspect understanding from each of the related taxonomies, and in order to have a complete understanding of the various options available for building a BBSS, they will have to flip from a resource to another in order to collect the scattered information they need. So, this paper aims to assist the blockchain SMEs to articulate a comprehensive understanding of the various and most recent concepts and design decisions available, in order to implement or propose a BBSS solution. The taxonomy is derived from the fundamental knowledge and the major SWE aspects which a BBSS implementer or researcher has to consider, and thus is not biased to a specific SWE aspect.",

This article attempts to propose a security evaluation model for blockchain software and hardware fusion devices based on decision tree algorithms. From the perspective of blockchain technology architecture, it fully reveals the security risks of evaluated blockchain projects for software and hardware fusion devices. It is necessary to conduct a comprehensive analysis of various technologies that affect the security risks of blockchain software and hardware fusion devices. By reusing the kernel through decision tree algorithm, a system chip that meets predetermined requirements can be quickly constructed, integrating processor modules and some commonly used functional modules. The research results indicate that the detection rate of the experimental group model is consistently higher than that of the traditional model. During the detection rate process, the average value of the experimental group is as high as 89.3%, which is much higher than the traditional model. Furthermore, the error detection rate curve remains at the lowest position, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation model.",

However, because of the limited throughput, current blockchain platforms can not meet the transaction demand in practical use. Though researchers proposed many new solutions, they suffered either decentralization or security issues. In this paper, using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure, we improve the linear structure of traditional blockchain protocol. In the new structure, blocks are organized in levels and width, which will generate into a compacted DAG structure (CoDAG). To make CoDAG more efficient and secure, we design algorithms and protocols to place the new-generated blocks appropriately. Compared with traditional blockchain protocols, CoDAG improves the security and transaction verification time, and enjoys the consistency and liveness properties of blockchain. Taking adversary parties into consideration, two possible attack strategies are presented in this paper, and we further prove that CoDAG is a secure and robust protocol to resist them. The experimental results show that CoDAG can achieve 394 transactions per second, which is 56 times of Bitcoin's throughput and 26 times of Ethereum's.",

Unfortunately, some inherent limitations of blockchain have been rarely addressed by the most existing works when applying blockchain into crowdsourcing, which becomes the performance bottleneck of crowdsourcing systems. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid blockchain crowdsourcing platform to achieve decentralization and privacy preservation. Our platform integrates with a hybrid blockchain structure, dual-ledgers, and dual consensus algorithms to ensure secure communication between the requesters and the workers. Moreover, the smart contract and zero-knowledge proof are employed to ensure automatic operation of the tasks and the protection users' privacy, respectively. Finally, we conduct experiments to confirm the efficiency of the adopted consensus algorithm on our platform by comparing it with the state-of-the-art.",

            "abstract": "Energy storage units (ESUs) enable several attractive features of modern smart grids such as enhanced grid resilience, effective demand response, and reduced bills. However, uncoordinated charging of ESUs stresses the power system and can lead to a blackout. In this paper, we leverage the blockchain and smart contracts to build a decentralized charging coordination mechanism without the need for a centralized charging coordinator. First ESUs should use tokens for anonymously authenticate themselves to the blockchain. Then each ESU sends a charging request that contains its State-of-Charge (SoC), Time-to-complete-charge (TCC) and amount of required charging to the smart contract address on the blockchain. The smart contract will then run the charging coordination mechanism in a self-executed manner such that ESUs with the highest priorities are charged in the present time slot while charging requests of lower priority ESUs are deferred to future time slots. In this way, each ESU can make sure that charging schedules are computed correctly. Finally, we have implemented the proposed mechanism on the Ethereum test-bed blockchain, and our analysis shows that execution cost can be acceptable in terms of gas consumption while enabling decentralized charging coordination with increased transparency, reliability, and privacy preserving.",

            "abstract": "Recently, leading research communities have been investigating the use of blockchains for Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, where multiple participants, or agents, collaborate to make consensus decisions. To achieve this, the data in the blockchain storage have to be transformed into blockchain knowledge. We refer to these types of blockchains as knowledge-based blockchains. Knowledge-based blockchains are potentially useful in building efficient risk assessment applications. An earlier work introduced probabilistic blockchain which facilitates knowledge-based blockchains. This paper proposes an extension for the probabilistic blockchain concept. The design of a reputation management framework, suitable for such blockchains, is proposed. The framework has been developed to suit the requirements of a wide range of applications. In particular, we apply it to the detection of malicious nodes and reduce their effect on the probabilistic blockchains' consensus process. We evaluate the framework by comparing it to a baseline using several adversarial strategies. Further, we analyze the collaborative decisions with and without the malicious node detection. Both results show a sustainable performance, where the proposed work outperforms others and achieves excellent results.",

            "abstract": "The fast developing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies provide a promising opportunity to build large-scale systems to connect numerous heterogeneous devices into the Internet. Most existing IIoT infrastructures are based on a centralized architecture, which is easier for management but cannot effectively support immutable and verifiable services among multiple parties. Blockchain technology provides many desired features for large-scale IIoT infrastructures, such as decentralization, trustworthiness, trackability, and immutability. This paper presents a blockchain-based IIoT architecture to support immutable and verifiable services. However, when applying blockchain technology to the IIoT infrastructure, the required storage space posts a grant challenge to resource-constrained IIoT infrastructures. To address the storage issue, this paper proposes a hierarchical blockchain storage structure, ChainSplitter. Specially, the proposed architecture features a hierarchical storage structure where the majority of the blockchain is stored in the clouds, while the most recent blocks are stored in the overlay network of the individual IIoT networks. The proposed architecture seamlessly binds local IIoT networks, the blockchain overlay network, and the cloud infrastructure together through two connectors, the blockchain connector and the cloud connector, to construct the hierarchical blockchain storage. The blockchain connector in the overlay network builds blocks in blockchain from data generated in IIoT networks, and the cloud connector resolves the blockchain synchronization issues between the overlay network and the clouds. We also provide a case study to show the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical blockchain storage in a practical Industrial IoT case.",

These blockchain platforms are not able to interact with each other or with the outside world since only little emphasis is placed on the interoperability between them. Already proposed solutions for blockchain interoperability such as naive relay or oracle solutions are usually not broadly applicable since they are either too expensive to operate or very resource-intensive. For that reason, we propose a blockchain interoperability oracle that follows a voting-based approach based on threshold signatures. The oracle nodes generate a distributed private key to execute an off-chain aggregation mechanism to collectively respond to requests. Compared to state-of-the-art relay schemes, our approach does not incur any ongoing costs and since the on-chain component only needs to verify a single signature, we can achieve remarkable cost savings compared to conventional oracle solutions.",

For worthwhile research into the use Blockchains, they often must be deployed into environments that are as close to real-world scenarios as possible. Real-world networks are large and complex and therefore the Blockchains used to research them should be large and complex. Creating large Blockchains like this may seem out-of-reach for the humble researcher. The tool introduced in this paper - Containerchain - seeks to make it much easier to spin up a large Blockchain system with little-or-no setup. The ultimate goal being to allow researchers to spend more time on actual research, rather than on setting up the network. Containerchain allows the user to deploy a real Blockchain system (not simulated) with several configurable parameters at their disposal. The user can control the number of nodes in the system, the consensus mechanism used and can observe and analyze the network traffic in the Blockchain - which is recorded out-of-the-box.",

However, due to the distributed nature of blockchain, we may face implementation difficulties and high operational costs, for example. To facilitate this process, we propose a customizable blockchain-based document registration service that makes it possible to create different types of gen-eralized documents for various application domains and store them in one or more blockchains integrated in an Application Programming Interface (API).",

We envision a marketplace for IoT data streams that can unlock such potential value in a scalable way, by enabling any pairs of data providers and consumers to engage in data exchange transactions without any prior assumption of mutual trust. We present a marketplace model and architecture to support trading of streaming data, from the advertising of data assets to the stipulation of legally binding trading agreements, to their fulfilment and payment settlement. Crucially, we show that by using blockchain technology and Smart Contracts in particular, we can offer participants a trade-off between the cost of transactional data exchange, and the risk of data loss when trading with untrusted third parties. We experimentally assess such trade-offs on a testbed using Ethereum Smart Contracts.",

As the adoption of blockchain technologies by various sectors increases, there is a demand for tools that enable regulatory enforcement, which include monitoring, examining and ensuring compliance of the data stored by the blockchain systems, all in a privacy preserving way. Current blockchain solutions store transactions in append-only and immutable fashion without any indexing, which contributes to limited and inefficient queries. Additionally, there is no support for privacy-preserving query processing. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a system that can provide auditors, enforcing regulatory compliance, with efficient, scalable and richer blockchain query processing over Hadoop and synchronized Ethereum clients. The system additionally ensures auditors' privacy by utilizing cryptography techniques over semi-trusted servers to protect the auditors' identities, queries and their results.",

It is important to ensure the trustworthiness of the heterogeneous IoT data. To address this requirement, the data provenance needs to be used in the IoT system. In this article, we integrate the PROV-DM model into the IoT architecture and propose an IoT data provenance model. To avoid corrupting and forging the provenance information, we record the provenance data onto the blockchain. In addition, we use the IoT secure and computable data sharing system to illustrate that the proposed model can construct a provenance graph to detect which agent operates the IoT data abnormally. Finally, we implement and evaluate the proposed model on a public IoT database.",

Efforts are being made to reduce carbon footprint to mitigate such effects. Calculating the carbon footprint of food products is complex and requires the cooperation of all the stakeholders of the food supply chain. A record keeping system for tracking carbon footprint while preserving privacy for the related parties is needed. This paper presents a new implementation of blockchain for tracking of carbon footprint on food production and transportation stages. We designed a system that tracks the carbon footprint of food processing facilities and transportation parties using cluster-based record keeping while preserving their privacy. We implemented the proposed carbon footprint chain and evaluated its throughput and latency under different scenarios. We show that our blockchain implementation is capable of operating with a larger number of nodes without any scalability issues.",

However, the increasing proliferation of deep forgery technology has brought huge hidden dangers to the electronic data management of power grid enterprises, and it is urgent to build a trusted management system for electronic data. This paper proposes a blockchain-based deep forgery data identification and traceability framework. Firstly, a method of trusted identification of electronic data based on blockchain is proposed, which constructs the unique identification of data and embeds it in the electronic data as a digital watermark. Second, introduce blockchain-based electronic data forensic appraisal technology to conduct authenticity and similarity analysis of electronic data. Finally, a deep forgery data traceability mechanism based on digital identification is designed to realize deep forgery data traceability and dissemination supervision. After comparative analysis, the framework is more secure and efficient in deep forgery data supervision, and can provide key support for building a trusted content system in cyberspace.",

            "abstract": "Many variants of (delegated) Proof-of-Stake blockchains have been introduced since 2016, among which Cardano, Algorand, and Tezos have been more widely adopted. Each of these blockchains has attempted to address the scalability and consumption issues of Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains from different angles. However, the economic incentives of these blockchains have raised the concern about the decentralisation level of key players, such as validators, and stakeholders, in those \u201cexpected to be decentralised\u201d networks. In this work, we conduct an analysis of Cardano's activity and wealth concentration. For the first time, we perform a clustering of the addresses that belong to the same wallet based on existing heuristics for UTXO-like blockchains. Moreover, an analysis of reward distribution on Cardano is presented. The analysis results of this work disclose objective insights into the Cardano blockchain, including the rewards distribution, stake balance distribution, and wealth concentration.",

            "abstract": "5G technology's rapid development revolutionized the field of cellular networks by providing higher data rate up to 10 Gbit/s using millimetre waves. Though 5G network can carry huge data with a higher speed than 4G, it can cover only a shorter province, around 1000 feet which is not even 2% of 4G's coverage. Numerous 5G cell towers and antennas are required to ensure reliable 5G signal and connectivity. This resulted in frequent and increased authentication when User Equipment (UE) moves between cells. Therefore, there is a critical need for a fast and frequent authentication mechanism. Though existing 4G authentication protocols can be adopted for 5G, they can only satisfy the basic requirements on the security front but cannot handle frequent authentications effectively. Blockchain technology with the features such as security, anonymity, immutability and transparency has been considered a promising technology to evade redundant authentications. Therefore, an effective and secure authentication scheme by completely utilizing features of Blockchain technology has been proposed in this paper. The proposed methodology works in two steps, the first by the introduction of a novel optimized authentication specific consensus algorithm for improving the Authentication Rate. Second, the reduction of the authentication by utilizing the authentication results stored in UE-AP Blockchain aiming to handle the redundant authentications.",

It incorporates well-known technologies, including BitTorrent and Git, to create a swarm of computing systems that share information. Since its introduction in 2016, IPFS has seen great improvements and adoption from both individuals and enterprise organizations. Its distributed network allows users to share files and information across the globe. IPFS works well with large files that may consume or require large bandwidth to upload and/or download over the Internet. The rapid adoption of this distributed file system is in part because IPFS is designed to operate on top of different protocols, such as FTP and HTTP. However, there are underpinning concerns relating to security and access control, for example lack of traceability on how the files are accessed. The aim of this paper is to complement IPFS with blockchain technology, by proposing a new approach (BlockIPFS) to create a clear audit trail. BlockIPFS allows us to achieve improved trustworthiness of the data and authorship protection, and provide a clear route to trace back all activities associated with a given file using blockchain as a service.",

However, Traditional centralized storage cannot meet performance and security requirements and fully distributed storage consumes a large amount of computing, storage and network resources, which is inefficient and difficult to implement. In this paper, we propose a clustering strategy on node community clustering by constructing a trust model based on the decentralization of blockchain technology. We introduce a multi-chain storage structure. Our experiments show that the proposed strategy reduces data synchronization time and storage space, improves system performance by enabling efficient parallel processing.",

To guide decision making in this regard, we systematically explore this architectural design space and possible solution strategies. More precisely, we provide architectural design decisions and decision options in terms of patterns and practices. Our research shows that most design decisions are influenced by the need to offset current blockchain drawbacks such as scalability, privacy, and usability by using centralized elements. This suggests that a hybrid architecture is beneficial in many design situations.",

Accountability is a desirable property of distributed systems that enables the detection, identification, and removal of faulty or malicious behavior. It is a complementary approach to Byzantine fault tolerance, which is concerned with ensuring continued functioning of the system in the presence of Byzantine faults. Our proof of concept consists of a Raspberry Pi acting as a human interface; the blockchain is implemented in Hyperledger Fabric and the Raspberry Pi runs a lightweight blockchain client to minimize computational burden. The application shows that we are able to use smart contracts to detect and identify faulty or malicious hardware, and the permissioning framework to remove it.",

However, the traditional loyalty program has problems such as inability to interact across platforms and lack of credibility. The points alliance is an effective measure to solve the above problems. By formulating the corresponding points exchange agreement within the alliance, the barriers of data interaction between different platforms can be broken. Blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization and distribution, which is consistent with the technical needs of the points alliance. Based on the research of decentralized exchange, this paper designs a blockchain-based points trading mechanism, and explains the details of points trading and the implementation of order matching. The mechanism proposed in this paper helps to increase the probability of successful exchange of points, thus increasing the use value of loyalty points.",

Existing centralized data sharing and access systems provide less transparency and traceability as the users have to trust a centralized authority and its decision making for the entire system. There is a need for decentralized distributed data storage and access without a central authority. Blockchain provides promising solutions to such needs. However, the existing decentralized blockchain-based solutions are complex and involve financial incentives, which limits their applications. We propose a secure permissioned blockchain-based decentralized system, VAULT, with a novel quorum-based consensus. We store encrypted files using Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and the references to the files in the blockchain. VAULT is designed for applications involving collaboration from multiple permissioned parties, and users can store, access, and share data as well as manage projects through blockchain. Our experimental results show that our quorum selection is fair, and the VAULT protocol is scalable.",

Because of its unforgeable, traceable, open, and transparent, and collective maintenance features, it has laid a solid foundation of \u201ctrust\u201d. At the same time, the blockchain also brings hidden dangers of data security. How to protect the data security of digital currency in blockchain transactions is the direction of this article. This article first analyzes the basic structure of the blockchain, and then takes Bitcoin in the digital currency as an example to introduce its technical principles and implementation process. Finally, the PBFT algorithm is proposed, which can search for the application of encryption in the blockchain consensus mechanism. The experimental data verification proves the future application prospects of blockchain-based digital currency using PBFT algorithm to protect data security.",

Understanding how different blockchains compare in performance has become more important than ever, yet each blockchian paper uses its own inconsistent standards for performance analysis. There are few mechanisms that may allow for consistent performance analysis among multiple blockchains. This paper details the implementation of the first-ever multi-layer blockchain parameter tuning system: Parameter Space Exploration. Our system is primarily targeted at the performance issue but also takes into consideration power consumption. Multi-layer blockchains use a permissioned blockchain to solve performance deficits. We find that the side chain is the determining factor for the performance of a multi-layer system; our side chain is chosen among a set of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) and Crash Fault Tolerance (CFT) based consensus algorithms as they are more energy-efficient and have higher performance than their Proof of Work (PoW) counterparts. Our proposed Parameter Space Exploration has two elements: (1) The concept of a parameter space; (2) A side-by-side benchmarking system for balanced comparison among different multi-layer blockchains and consensus algorithms.",

The main focus of this work is to systematize knowledge about security and privacy issues of blockchains. To this end, we propose a security reference architecture based on models that demonstrate the stacked hierarchy of various threats as well as threat-risk assessment using ISO/IEC 15408. In contrast to the previous surveys [23], [88], [11], we focus on the categorization of security vulnerabilities based on their origins and using the proposed architecture we present existing prevention and mitigation techniques. The scope of our work mainly covers aspects related to the nature of blockchains, while we mention operational security issues and countermeasures only tangentially.",

Networks based on Proof-of-Authority (PoA) and compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) are particularly advantageous in this scenario, providing both efficiency and straightforward setup. While private blockchains inherently enhance security by their permissioned nature, which restricts node participation to authorised entities only, it\u2019s crucial to recognise the ongoing necessity for additional safeguards. These safeguards are essential to guarantee that only verified and trustworthy smart contracts are deployed. A key concern in this realm is addressing particular attack vectors, such as front-running attacks. This paper presents an innovative proxy-layer solution designed to integrate effortlessly with any EVM-compatible blockchain, thereby strengthening both governance and security aspects.",

            "abstract": "Nowadays, the rise in popularity of massive open online courses (MOOCs) is significant. However, current online education service heavily relies on a third-party platform, which acts as a middleman to process transactions occurred among system participants. On the one hand, this centralized business model is based on database management system, once compromised, the data consistency and safety of transaction records can no longer be guaranteed. On the other hand, it's more expensive to resolve disputes and possible fraud transactions via a mediator than a direct peer-to-peer trusted payment. Aiming at solving issues regarding security and inefficiencies, we propose a crypto-asset EduCoin which is designed for secure and efficient payment in MOOC environment. Specially, we present a multi-party business model based on permissioned blockchain, Composer smart contracts and network topologies that utilize the three-tiered functional architecture of Fabric to achieve fast payment and trusted audit. By leveraging benchmark tools Caliper and Hitchhiker, we develop typical workloads based on transaction scenarios applying EduCoin. The experimental results demonstrate the practicality of EduCoin and offer insights into the design trade-offs and performance bottlenecks in production. We have released EduCoin for public use.",

Tokens define chunks of data on a blockchain, allowing it to be distributed like virtual currency. However, storing all data related to digital assets in a token is difficult. Data is currently managed separately because storing a large amount of data in a blockchain can cause the ledger to grow large. When the management of data depends on a particular organization, the stability of the token's value depends on that particular organization. In this paper, we propose an organization-independent management method that combines a distributed content-addressable file system with a blockchain. Our proposed method places the data associated with the token and the access information to the token into the distributed content-addressable file system. As a result, the token associated with the data has the sharing control of the data stored in the distributed content-addressable file system, and a configuration independent of the specific contract is realized.",

            "abstract": "Blockchain has recently emerged as an important tool that can enable critical distributed applications without requiring centralized trust. For example, public blockchains have been used to enable many different cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, existing public blockchains and smart contracts deployed on them may disclose sensitive information. Although there is some ongoing work that leverage advanced cryptography to address some of these sensitive information leakage issues, they require significant changes to existing and popular blockchains such as Ethereum and are usually computationally expensive. On the other hand, private blockchains have been proposed to allow more efficient and privacy-preserving data sharing among pre-approved group of nodes/participants. Although private blockchains address some of the privacy challenges by allowing sensitive data to be only seen by the select group of participants, they do not allow public accountability of transactions since transactions are approved by known set of users, and cannot be accessed publicly. Given these observations, one natural question that arise is, can we leverage both public and private blockchain infrastructures to enable efficient, privacy enhancing and accountable applications? In this work, we try to address this challenge in the context of digital auctions. Mainly, we propose a novel hybrid blockchain architecture that combines private and public blockchains to allow sensitive bids to be opened on a private blockchain so that only the auctioneer can learn the bids, and no one else. At the same time, we leverage public blockchains to make the auction winner announcement, and payments accountable. Furthermore, using smart contracts deployed on public blockchain, we show how to incentivize truthful behavior among the auction participants. Our extensive empirical results show that this architecture is more efficient in terms of run time and monetary cost compared to pure public blockchain based aucti...",

As factories move towards smart development, the existing network security systems can no longer meet the needs of enterprises and users. Aiming at the hidden dangers of information leakage and illegal access to the data of cryptographic production facilities and products in the smart factory, the article combines the core technology of the Internet of Things radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and blockchain technology, and proposes a blockchain-based technology, the lightweight password security authentication mechanism of the smart factory RFID system, which has the characteristics of lightweight, anti-data leakage, and low management cost. It can ensure the safe and reliable access of industrial data while preventing the application of RFID in smart factories. Security issues such as replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and server spoofing attacks also provide new ideas for the research on data security protection for smart factories.",

Reasons for this are non-existent standards, changing specifications d ue t o rapid development, common usage of the off-chain storage, and lack of developers. One of such blockchains is Polkadot - a layer- zero blockchain featuring a single relay chain whose role is to secure smart contract transactions on multiple other parachains. In this paper we describe a data collection pipeline for Polkadot blockchain that we then use to perform an analysis of the bow-tie structure of its transfer network over time, with special emphasis on the role of nominators and validators in this structure. We find evidence that t he Polkadot ecosystem iss lowly maturing from a system dominated by nominators and validators, both of which require some technical skill as well as willingness to bond sufficient amount of funds, into a system increasingly populated by regular users using the financial services of Polkadot.",

However, as with any new technology, adoption of blockchain carries with it, as yet not widely known, risks that should be properly evaluated and understood prior to design and development. Given the purely distributed nature of blockchain, in which nodes can span continents, a key aspect in planning and designing blockchain systems which is not readily incorporated in a modern architect\u2019s vernacular is consideration of eventual consistency, system stability and scalability when designing blockchain based systems. This is compounded by the fact that, as yet, very few practical tools are available to help architects better understand and plan for the above. In this paper we introduce BlockSIM, a comprehensive and open source blockchain system simulation tool which can assist blockchain architects better evaluate the performance of planned private blockchain networks by running scenarios and decide the optimal system parameters suited for their purposes. We compare the results of our simulation with real blockchain networks and demonstrate that BlockSIM can be used effectively by architects of blockchain systems to plan and implement scalable, stable and resilient blockchain networks. Finally, we demonstrate via a real life example how architects can apply BlockSIM to plan and design real-world blockchain systems.",

However, several challenges such as low processing speed, scalability, and vulnerability to certain attacks have been identified, making it difficult to apply the technology on general industrial applications. In this paper, we propose a new application service platform architecture on top of blockchain that resolves those challenges. The proposed architecture takes advantage of private blockchain to secure processing speed and security while allowing public open use of the system by dividing the system into multiple layers. Assuming arbitrary nodes can participate in service, we propose periodic node verification process and `query-chain' to effectively authenticate and validate arbitrary nodes.",

However, the operation efficiency (about 10min/per block) has limited its practical application except of Bitcoin. In this paper, we conduct further research based on the existing hybrid blockchain architectures, say N + X Hybrid Blockchain, which may significantly improve blockchain efficiency with the negligible cost of security. Moreover, we gave an evaluation model for the feedback process of nodes in the N+X Hybrid Blockchain and obtained optimal strategies. For the application of Energy Internet (EI), we proposed a scheduling mechanism based on the above evaluation model, and given an algorithm to implement it.",

Traditional IoT access control systems are centralized and do not include all the stakeholders in the access control decision making process. To fill this gap, we propose a permissioned blockchain based access control system for IoT where a different phase of access control like creating access policy and making the access control decision happens based on the consensus of all the stakeholders. To be more specific, we design and implement Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) in a permissioned blockchain called Hyperledger Fabric and leverage its smartcontract and distributed consensus to enable a distributed access control for IoT. The effectiveness of our proposed system is demonstrated by the performance evaluation result in an IoT testbed.",

Since the neural key exchange is based on synchronizing weights within the neural network structure, the security of the algorithm does not depend on the attacker's computational capabilities. However, due to the neural key exchange's repetitive mutual-learning processes, using explicit user authentication methods -such as a public key certificate- is inefficient due to high communication overhead. Implicit authentication based on information that only authorized users know can significantly reduce overhead in communications. However, there was a lack of realistic methods to distribute secret information for authentication among authorized users. In this paper, we propose the concept idea of distributing shared secret values for implicit authentication based on the randomness of the public blockchain. Moreover, we present a method to prevent the unintentional disclosure of shared secret values to third parties in the network due to the transparency of the blockchain.",

            "abstract": "In permissioned blockchains, a set of identifiable miners are in charge of consolidating the new blocks. The agreement protocol is usually based on a consensus mechanism inspired by a voting Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) mechanism rather than the well-known proof-of-work (PoW). However, PoW provides some benefits with respect to BFT, i.e., it allows the final user to quantify the effort required to change a consolidated transaction without the need of trusting the consortium of miners. In this paper, we address some of the problems that arise from the application of PoW in permissioned blockchains. In fact, in standard PoW, it may be easy for one miner to temporary reach 50% of the total hash power and since mining rewards are usually not expected, the problem of balancing the efforts of the miner becomes crucial. We propose a simple solution based on a sliding window algorithm to address these problems and analyse its effectiveness in terms of security. Additionally, we propose a quantitative model whose solution allows us to assess its capacity of balancing the hash power provided by heterogeneous miners.",

Blockchain (BC) has many technical characteristics, such as decentralization, impossibility of being tampered with and forged, which makes it have incomparable advantages in ensuring information credibility, security, traceability and other aspects of traditional technology. In this paper, a method of constructing PKI certificate system based on permissioned BC is proposed. The problems of multi-CA mutual trust, poor certificate configuration efficiency and single point failure in digital certificate system are solved by using the characteristics of BC distribution and non-tampering. At the same time, in order to solve the problem of identity privacy on BC, this paper proposes a privacy-aware PKI system based on permissioned BCs. This system is an anonymous digital certificate publishing scheme., which achieves the separation of user registration and authorization, and has the characteristics of anonymity and conditional traceability, so as to realize to protect user's identity privacy. The system meets the requirements of certificate security and anonymity, reduces the cost of CA construction, operation and maintenance in traditional PKI technology, and improves the efficiency of certificate application and configuration.",

Blockchain technology has the potential to counter these challenges by combining peer-to-peer networks, cryptography, and consensus algorithms. A blockchain is a decentralized database that stores transactions and data transparently, chronologically, and tamper-proof in a distributed network. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based industrial marketplace, where machines have an identity and account for selecting, ordering, and paying materials in an automated manner using smart contracts. This allows manufacturers with a low real-net-output-ratio, such as car manufacturers that depend on numerous suppliers, to optimize their purchasing processes. Using our case study, we demonstrate prototypical implementation of the decentralized marketplace and its applications in the area of industrial maintenance. Furthermore, we conducted a semi-structured interview with procurement and information technology experts from the automotive industry. The results indicate that our prototype offers a promising approach streamlining procurement processes within the next two to five years.",

            "abstract": "As large-scale construction projects become increasingly complex, the use and integration of advanced technologies are being emphasized more and more. However, the construction industry often lags behind most industries in the application of digital technologies. In recent years, a decentralized, peer-to-peer blockchain technology has attracted widespread attention from academia and industry. This paper provides a solution that combines blockchain technology with construction project fund management. The system involves participants such as the owner's unit, construction companies, government departments, banks, etc., adopting the technical architecture of the \u201cXiong'an Blockchain Underlying System\u201d. The core business and key logic processing are all implemented through smart contracts, ensuring the transparency and traceability of the fund payment process. The goal of ensuring investment quality, standardizing investment behavior, and strengthening cost control is achieved through blockchain technology. The application of this system in the management of Xiong'an construction projects has verified that blockchain technology plays a significant positive role in strengthening fund management, enhancing fund supervision, and ensuring fund safety in the construction process of engineering projects. It helps to eliminate the common problems of multi-party trust and transparent supervision in the industry and can further improve the investment benefits of government investment projects and improve the management system and operation mechanism of investment projects.",

However, the lack of transparency about everyday activities and progresses towards long term goals could result in a loss of interest for the community and more difficulties in achieving desired results. In our proposed approach, data related to waste collection would be automatically passed from sensors to a blockchain smart contract. Such data include the amount of waste collected for each category from a citizen. By using a blockchain storing data related to collected waste, maximum data integrity and transparency would be ensured. Furthermore, citizens are provided with a smartphone app to read data from the blockchain, register other data concerning their activities, and check their fee balance. The overall solution, by ensuring that each citizen can monitor their progress and the global results achieved by the community, would address and foster participation.",

            "abstract": "The tourism industry is a new sector that stimulates consumer spending and drives economic growth, with the internet providing effective measures for its rapid development. Traditional online tourism service platforms, managed by a single entity, face trust barriers between different industries, hindering further development in tourism. The open and transparent nature of blockchain can effectively solve trust issues. However, existing solutions lack a study on the business processes of tourism services. The tourism industry still facing challenges such as cumbersome business processes, low coordination efficiency among stakeholders, and difficulties in service execution monitoring. Based on the above issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-based tourism service level agreement execution framework to establish a tourism service level agreement (TSLA) between tourists and service providers to realize the service provider's commitment to tourists. Furthermore, this paper designs a Tourism Service Level Agreement Smart Contract (TSLA-SC) based on oracle technology, stores the service execution process on the blockchain, tracks potential malicious behaviors of service providers, and sets corresponding reward and punishment measures to automate the TSLA execution process. Finally, experiments are conducted to test the cost and time expenses of TSLA-SC, with results indicating that the proposed solution can operate at lower costs, demonstrating good usability in terms of cost overhead.",

MACS addresses the primary coin selection requirements regarding transaction fee, transaction size, UTXO pool size, transaction age, and privacy. We compare the performance of MACS with other coin selection algorithms. The performance evaluation shows that MACS achieves the mentioned requirements while outperforming other coin selection algorithms in terms of having a wider distribution of their number of UTXO inputs. Moreover, UTXOs will not remain in the UTXO pool forever when the MACS algorithm is used since MACS keeps the fraction of old UTXOs oscillating between\n0%\nand\n20%\n.",

            "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) bears unprecedented security and scalability challenges due to the magnitude of data produced and exchanged by IoT devices and platforms. Some of those challenges are currently being addressed by coupling IoT applications with blockchains. However, current blockchain-backed IoT systems simply use the blockchain to store access control policies, thereby underutilizing the power of blockchain technology. In this paper, we propose a new framework named Sash that couples IoT platforms with blockchain that provides a number of advantages compared to state of the art. In Sash, the blockchain is used to store access control policies and take access control decisions. Therefore, both changes to policies and access requests are correctly enforced and publicly auditable. Further, we devise a \"data marketplace\" by leveraging the ability of blockchains to handle financial transaction and providing \"by design\" remuneration to data producers. Finally, we exploit a special flavor of identity-based encryption to cater for cryptography-enforced access control while minimizing the overhead to distribute decryption keys. We prototype Sash by using the FIWARE open source IoT platform and the Hyperledger Fabric framework as the blockchain back-end. We also evaluate the performance of our prototype and show that it incurs tolerable overhead in realistic deployment settings.",

In this paper, we adopt a multiple input LSTM-based prediction model in conjunction with the Black-Scholes (BS) model to address this challenge in Bitcoin option pricing. We discuss the relationship between on/off-chain transactions and predict the implied price volatility of the next 30 days, which is the main factor in the BS model. First, we analyze the Blockchain statistics and social network trends of Bitcoin as inputs to our model, including the liveness of Blockchain wallet, the scale of active Blockchain nodes and the impact factor of Google, Reddit, Twitter to name a few. Next, we implement the LSTM-based prediction model and evaluate it in various historical window sizes and network parameters. Finally, we compare the performance with the baseline model without Blockchain statistics inputs. The experimental results show that the proposed multi-input LSTM-based prediction model provides the risk-informed pricing of the Bitcoin call options and our Blockchain statistics reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by up to 46.2%.",

            "abstract": "Blockchain technology has positively impacted traceability across various industries such as logistics and shipping. By overcoming the problem of data silos among organizations and concentration of authority, this innovative approach allows a decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger to be built. On the other hand, the use of non-fungible tokens, a new concept for projecting digital and physical goods on a blockchain, is expected to be able to represent complicated operations in traceability systems. However, the existing token design lacks an efficient model for retrieval of past histories. The most popular way to retrieve past information on tokens is to use blockchain explorers, which are centralized trusted parties. Otherwise, so far there is only a naive way to examine all block headers, and it takes a vast amount of time. Our preliminary study shows that the processing time for retrieving all histories of 1,030 tokens on the Ethereum mainnet takes approximately 57 minutes. We propose a new token design based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that allows token histories to be efficiently explored without examining the whole blockchain. The model associates each state of the token from past to latest and covers expressions of relationships between tokens, such as merge and split. Our implementation and evaluation reveal that the DAG-based token design significantly improves the efficiency of exploring token transfer histories. The results show that our method can complete the exploration for 1,030 tokens in a matter of seconds and maintains performance over the long term even if the blockchain grows.",

The potential of the blockchain technology cannot be fully realized unless it is made more scalable. We extend previous analysis on a fundamental trade-off between the throughput and forking rate of the blockchain system. We further propose FastChain to increase the throughput of the blockchain system by reducing the block propagation time. FastChain adopts bandwidth-informed neighbor selection. Miners disconnect from bandwidth-limited neighbors and favor the nodes with higher bandwidth. We build a Blockchain Dynamics Simulator (BDSim) to evaluate the performance of FastChain. FastChain improves the throughput by 20%~40% in the normal operations.",

Since their inception, several innovative projects have been proposing solutions to the blockchain trilemma, improving blockchain features and its technical limitations. However, the adoption of blockchain as a technology or a software component, requires a comprehensive understanding and characterization of their technical principles and characteristics. The latter introduces an uncertainty for an organization to decide which blockchain protocol best meets its needs and demands. In general, there is a lack of proper testing and software engineering practices for assessing the usage of blockchains usage and understanding their performance. Towards that direction, this paper presents an architecture for a blockchain benchmarking framework which aims at the deployment and evaluation of different blockchain protocols, focusing on different aspects such as security and scalability. A set of modules is introduced for testing and evaluating the behaviour of blockchain protocols under different test scenarios.",

It is a distributed ledger technology combined with a variety of network technologies. In essence, it is a decentralized database. In short, the database can be regarded as an account book, and everyone can participate in bookkeeping. As a distributed accounting technology, blockchain makes it possible to monitor the logistics transportation process in real time, and it also makes it easier to track down the responsibility in case of goods to goods problems. Since each node of the blockchain has bookkeeping permission, each entity in the goods transportation can also record the logistics information on the blockchain, which not only records the whole process of goods from delivery to receipt in real time, but also realizes the sharing, openness and transparency of logistics information. blockchain technology takes \u201cdistributed ledger\u201d as the solution, and its essence is a decentralized data storage technology. In blockchain technology, there is no central node, each node is completely equal, and all nodes jointly maintain the public database through encryption protocol.

            "abstract": "The increase in cyberattacks against the healthcare system, notably Electronic Health Records (EHRs) breaches, has cost the healthcare providers more in recent years. This situation is estimated to increase in the coming years as the healthcare systems are proposing a consortium EHRs repository. In an attempt to secure these health records, researchers propose firewalls, cryptography, cloud antivirus. Although these approaches proved useful and practical in protecting EHRs; however, the shared data security cannot be guaranteed. More specifically, maintaining the integrity and consistency of shared EHRs becomes a significant concern. In this on-going research, we propose a blockchain-based solution that facilitates a scalable and secured inter-healthcare EHRs exchange. These healthcare providers maintain their records on separate blockchain networks and are independent of each other. The proposed architecture can detect and prevent malicious activities on both EHRs at rest and in transit. It can also verify the integrity and consistency of EHR requests and replies from other healthcare systems and presents them in a format that can be easily understood by different healthcare nodes. We evaluate the security analysis against frequently encounter outsider and insider threats within a healthcare system in the preliminary result. The result shows that the architecture detects and prevents insider threats from uploading compromising EHRs into the blockchain and prevents unauthorized retrieval of patient information.",

However, while public blockchain is generally transparent, energy trading information is sensitive and thus requires a privacy-preserving mechanism. In this paper, we design a privacy-preserving energy trading mechanism by using blockchain and zero-knowledge proofs. A user uploads a commitment to the blockchain instead of the original bid amount, and the zero-knowledge proof of commitment is uploaded into the blockchain. Other participants can verify the correctness of energy trading in each auction match. Our experiments show the design is feasible and efficient in Ethereum although there are more gas consumptions.",

In this paper, we present a formula that explicitly expresses the trilemma for Proof of Work blockchains.

            "abstract": "This paper presents a demonstration of anonymous authentication on trust within a blockchain-based Mobile Crowdsourcing System (MCS). MCS has gained substantial attention from both academic and industrial sectors as an effective method for data collection. Nevertheless, traditional MCS heavily relies on third parties to maintain system operations, which may lead to single-point failures and incur serious privacy concerns. The introduction of blockchain technology offers the potential to get rid of the third-party intermediaries. However, the inherent decentralized and transparent nature of blockchain also brings in new challenges related to privacy and trust. A critical challenge in the context of blockchain-based MCS is achieving anonymous authentication on trust. Despite the typical conflict between trust evaluation and anonymity, ensuring anonymity is a crucial privacy prerequisite for MCS, while trust plays a pivotal role in various MCS activities such as task selection and truth determination. In this paper, we present a demonstration of a novel blockchain-based MCS that provides a secure and efficient crowdsourcing platform for fair and effective allocation of tasks. Notably, we leverage Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) to achieve anonymous authentication within a decentralized environment. Through the implementation of a decentralized trust evaluation approach, our system enables accurate trust assessment.",

            "abstract": "Enterprise business transactions have both public and private information; hence blockchain adaptation to an enterprise business application needs current blockchain platforms to support both public and private information. Public blockchains (permissionless) are optimized for transparency; hence the sharing of private and sensitive information is challenging. On the other hand, private blockchains (permissioned) separate information about a transaction by generating a public transaction and a set of private transactions and treat them separately. This separation weakens the cohesiveness of transaction information and develops an extra burden when it is necessary to connect both public and private information which is not duly addressed in the literature. For example, auditing, regulatory activities, certifications, and traceability need both the public and private information about transactions. This paper uses semantic triples and introduces the Triples for Transactions(T4T) model to define blockchain transactions, improve cohesiveness and resolve the extra burden of connecting both private and public transactions. This paper presents a user-driven transaction analysis, transaction modelling using the T4T model, semantic querying, and REST endpoints to enrich transaction management. Sets of semantic triples can define both public and private information about a transaction while preserving cohesiveness of the information. This approach supports point-to-point sharing of sensitive information while preserving implicit relationships between both private and public information. We have implemented an auditing scenario in the proposed approach adopting Hyperledger Fabric and compared for performance with Hyperledger Fabric. The results showed that the proposed approach reduces the number of transaction cycles by 66% compared to Hyperledger Fabric and the performance of information retrieval is in O(N). This result is a significant improvement compared to Hyperledger F...",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the technologies of blockchains, the Internet of Things (IoT), etc. technologies have been drawing attention across different industries. In our experience, during a pandemic, we look for innovations and personalization of secure data sharing on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to provide better healthcare services. In the paper, we propose a decentralized record management system which is to share data over multiple independent blockchain entities. Each blockchain runs under the administration of an independent healthcare organization. In our design, data would be shared and integrated among multiple Hospital Information Systems (HIS) across different healthcare organizations. It gives doctors and healthcare personnel an easy and safe way to obtain the health records of patients across hospitals dynamically worldwide through negotiated Service-Layer Agreements (SLAs) to provide accurate medical services. Our system leverages blockchain properties to manage access authentication, retrieve medical data, and add new patient data entries. Without a centralized system and database, the design autonomously, dynamically, and securely governs the retrieval and storage of data traffic based on the SLAs. Further, we integrate the system design with the Bell-LaPadula access control model to maintain the confidentiality of security organized in a non-discretionary fashion for different layers of secrecy. Since an HIS runs within the security bounds of a healthcare authority, we can adopt the Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm, which is developed by the Go Ethereum (Geth) team. The PoA provides an efficient, low computational power consumption approach for securely validating the blockchains.",

            "abstract": "Missing interoperability is a prevalent issue in today's blockchain landscape. Due to this lack of interoperability, only smart contracts deployed on the same blockchain can call each other. Smart contract interactions across the boundaries of blockchains would, however, provide an opportunity to create cross-blockchain applications. Hence, an additional mechanism for the execution of cross-blockchain smart contract calls is desirable. Unfortunately, already proposed solutions usually require one or more trusted intermediaries, which eventually leads to a lower degree of decentralization. Therefore, we propose a novel framework to enable smart contract interoperability across different blockchains. The framework enables the execution of asynchronous cross-blockchain smart contract calls. It uses blockchain relays to maintain a high degree of decentralization while placing only minor trust in intermediaries. We provide a prototypical implementation for Ethereum-based blockchains and evaluate it regarding costs and execution time.",

While Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols mostly guarantee consistency (safety) in an asynchronous network using 3f+1 machines to overcome the simultaneous malicious failure of any f nodes, in many systems, e.g., blockchain systems, the number of available nodes (resources) is much more than 3f + 1. To utilize such extra resources, in this paper we introduce a model that leverages transaction parallelism by partitioning the nodes into clusters (partitions) and processing independent transactions on different partitions simultaneously. The model also shards the blockchain ledger, assigns different shards of the blockchain ledger to different clusters, and includes both intra-shard and cross-shard transactions. Since more than one cluster is involved in each cross-shard transaction, the ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph.",

To safe-guard security and privacy of EHR, access control is an essential mechanism for managing EHR data. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture to facilitate access control of EHR data by using both blockchain and edge node. Within the architecture, a blockchain-based controller manages identity and access control policies and serves as a tamper-proof log of access events. In addition, off-chain edge nodes store the EHR data and apply policies specified in Abbreviated Language For Authorization (ALFA) to enforce attribute-based access control on EHR data in collaboration with the blockchain-based access control logs. We evaluate the proposed hybrid architecture by utilizing Hyperledger Composer Fabric blockchain to measure the performance of executing smart contracts and ACL policies in terms of transaction processing time and response time against unauthorized data retrieval.",

This paper explores the issues of the current loyalty programs and how Blockchain technology can be used to tackle the underlying issues of traditional loyalty programs. Finally, we propose our own Blockchain-based universal loyalty platform, which aims at making loyalty programs more beneficial for customers, thereby increasing customer retention rates as well as more convenient for companies to have their own loyalty program.

Yet the number of investors in RE are much lower, because of the liquidity and global access. Tenants, owners, and investors are barely satisfied in the current system. In this paper, the goal is to try out the employment of blockchain in RE market and represent the facilities it can give to the RE market. The research to date leads to the following conclusions: Blockchain technology and smart contracts can sort out the classical issues that RE is facing with, and they offer much more meaningful tools for a game theoretic stable-priced market.",

A feasible solution to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions is via a mechanism that is laid out in Kyoto protocol in 1997. It was signed by close to 192 nations thus creating a system to monetize carbon emissions with an aim to build an authority over it. There have been efforts to build a system in previous decade too but there have been certain shortcomings. The major challenges which exist are data manipulation, lack of transparency and substantial costs. So we have come up with the idea of Blockchain which will build a carbon credit ecosystem thus guaranteeing us security, transparency, accessibility to the standardized carbon markets. We will also be using sensors to automate the data to out consortium.",

However, the problems of low credibility of data and mismatch between government budget and work requirements are existing in the current carbon emissions data verification business. In this paper, we proposed a blockchain-based carbon verification mechanism to address the problem of low credibility of carbon emissions data, and realized the full traceability of verification data through a data control model of \"private chain + alliance chain\". Then we designed a reverse auction algorithm based on ring signature to address the problem of mismatch between government budget and work requirements. We also use the alliance chain platform FISCO BCOS as the underlying architecture, designed the corresponding smart contract, and verify the feasibility of the system. The results are conducive to promoting the market-oriented and benign development of carbon verification business.",

            "abstract": "Blockchain has attracted considerable attention as a solution to the challenges of privacy, security and decentralisation for many applications. However, these characteristics of the blockchain result in ever growing ledger size, which is one of the major barriers to blockchain adoption in large-scale networks such as the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we propose Multi-Level Distributed Caching (MLDC) for blockchain storage optimisation which reduces data replication based on data access pattern. MLDC divides nodes into storage classes (SCs) by their node availability, and assigns each SC a different Access Frequency (AF) to remove data from the local storage. Over time, each node only stores frequently accessed data, so MLDC can reduce the total storage cost by 83% compared to conventional blockchain systems, while maintaining blockchain consistency and data availability with a slight increase in network overhead and data query delay.",

Since most blockchain nodes retain copies of the ledger, the blockchain brings the benefits of decentralization while also bringing privacy leakage issues. With the continuous development of blockchain applications, how to protect the privacy data on the blockchain platform is a very worthwhile research question. This paper first divides each blockchain transaction data into two parts: sensitive data and basic data, and then encrypts and hides the sensitive data into the HEVC video to protect the privacy transaction data of the blockchain. The experimental results show that this HEVC video steganography algorithm can effectively increase the privacy data embedding capacity and get good visual quality.",

Many believe that blockchain capabilities can be leveraged to comply with GDPR principles. This study focuses on the specific capabilities of blockchain technology and addresses the unique data protection challenges in the information age, aiming to identify and represent these relationships through an applicability model. The goal of this research is to present a model for evaluating and selecting blockchain applications that are aligned with GDPR requirements. This model is developed through a meta-synthesis method and qualitative content analysis of 67 articles that concentrate on the potential applications of blockchain in GDPR across various countries. These applications are defined based on an analysis of key blockchain capabilities such as transparency, immutability, and data encryption. Further, this study maps these capabilities to key GDPR requirements such as data minimization and accuracy, analyzing them from both facilitating and inhibiting perspectives. Ultimately, based on qualitative content analysis and an in-depth study of 31 articles selected through the Critical Assessment of Methods of Protein Structure Prediction method (CASP), this research offers a comprehensive model for understanding and leveraging blockchain technology in a manner that complies with GDPR requirements. according to this, the study contributes to the understanding of blockchain technology\u2019s applicability in meeting GDPR requirements, offering insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and technology developers on the strategic implementation of blockchain for data protection.",

In order to ensure the security of the video, we use data hiding technology to embed message that can ensure the security of the video into the video, at the same time, in order to improve the non-tamperability and non-forgery of data hiding. We construct the hash value of the message embedded in the original video, the hash value of the carrier video (video with embedded message) and the attribute message of the video as video metadata, and upload the video metadata to the blockchain network. Comparing the message extracted from the carrier video with the video metadata stored on the blockchain can achieve double verification of the video. At the same time, distributed storage of carrier video through IPFS can effectively store and manage large-scale video data, ensuring the security and high availability of videos.",

A PoS blockchain relies on external clocks, and each node synchronizes its local clock according to an external clock using Network Time Protocol (NTP) or a similar protocol. However, this external dependence is undesirable because it reduces the autonomy, sustainability and trustless nature of the blockchain. This paper presents a clock synchronization protocol for slot-based PoS blockchains. The proposed protocol estimates the block propagation time to ensure that the synchronization is closer to that of a real-world clock. In addition, the proposed method considers the clock drift and clock adjustment frequency to achieve more accurate synchronization. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method can synchronize with a time that is closer to that of a real-world clock and with higher accuracy than existing methods.",

Though significant progress has been achieved in reusing, remanufacturing, and recycling materials, using blockchain in the circular supply chain is still a relatively new idea and particularly challenging in the building industry. As a result, this study focuses on the importance of blockchain and circular economy in built-environment supply chains. We show the application method of utilising a blockchain-enabled digital platform and the idea of material passports to efficiently monitor materials and resources in the built environment. Based on the methodologies of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Life Cycle Costing (LCC), and Building Information Management (BIM), we suggest that blockchain can be used to track environmental performance (e.g. materials, energy, and carbon emissions) and value creation opportunities at each stage of the building life cycle.",

            "abstract": "Blockchain as a potentially disruptive technology can advance many different fields, e.g., cryptocurrencies, supply chains, and the industrial Internet of Things. The next-generation blockchain ecosystem is expected to consist of various homogeneous and heterogeneous distributed ledgers. These ledger systems will inevitably require a certain level of proper cooperation of multiple blockchains to enrich advanced functionalities and enhance interoperable capabilities for future applications. The interoperability among blockchains will revolutionize current blockchain design principles, like the emergence of the Internet. However, the development of cross-blockchain applications involves much complexity regarding the variety of underlying cross-blockchain communication. With that regard, we propose an efficient, interoperable blockchain architecture, InterTrust, to support interoperability and trustworthiness among arbitrary blockchain systems (including homogeneous and heterogeneous blockchains). It consists of an atomic cross-chain communication protocol, which can be considered an agnostic protocol to integrate existing blockchain systems smoothly. InterTrust is powered by two innovative techniques: threshold signature scheme and trusted hardware. The threshold signature scheme guarantees consistency and verifiability in the target blockchain systems, and the trusted hardware guarantees trusted services among distinct blockchain systems. Combining these two techniques provides an efficient cross-chain communication protocol to facilitate atomic swaps and interoperable operations between different blockchain systems. Our interoperable architecture is robust to support arbitrary blockchain systems. We also present the security analysis on the scenarios of integrating our protocol into Byzantine fault tolerance based blockchain systems.",

            "abstract": "The rise of generative AI has led many companies to hire freelanc-ers to harness its potential. However, this technology presents unique challenges to developers who have not previously engaged with it. Freelancers may find these challenges daunting due to the absence of organizational support and their reliance on positive client feedback. In a study involving 52 freelance developers, we identified multiple challenges associated with developing solutions based on generative AI. Freelancers often struggle with as-pects they perceive as unique to generative AI such as unpredict-ability of its output, the occurrence of hallucinations, and the in-consistent effort required due to trial-and-error prompting cycles. Further, the limitations of specific frameworks, such as token lim-its and long response times, add to the complexity. Hype-related issues, such as inflated client expectations and a rapidly evolving technological ecosystem, further exacerbate the difficulties. To address these issues, we propose Software Engineering for Generative AI (SE4GenAI) and Hype-Induced Software Engineering (HypeSE) as areas where the software engineering community can provide effective guidance. This support is essential for freelancers working with generative AI and other emerging technologies.",

            "abstract": "Smart contracts are integral to blockchain's growth, but their vulnerabilities pose a significant threat. Traditional vulnerability detection methods rely heavily on expert-defined complex rules that are labor-intensive and difficult to adapt to the explosive expansion of smart contracts. Some recent studies of neural network-based vulnerability detection also have room for improvement. Therefore, we propose SCVHUNTER, an extensible framework for smart contract vulnerability detection. Specifically, SCVHUNTER designs a heterogeneous semantic graph construction phase based on intermediate representations and a vulnerability detection phase based on a heterogeneous graph attention network for smart contracts. In particular, SCVHUNTER allows users to freely point out more important nodes in the graph, leveraging expert knowledge in a simpler way to aid the automatic capture of more information related to vulnerabilities. We tested SCVHUNTER on reentrancy, block info dependency, nested call, and transaction state dependency vulnerabilities. Results show remarkable performance, with accuracies of 93.72%, 91.07%, 85.41%, and 87.37% for these vulnerabilities, surpassing previous methods.",

            "abstract": "Vulnerability analysis is crucial for software security. Inspired by the success of pre-trained models on software engineering tasks, this work focuses on using pre-training techniques to enhance the understanding of vulnerable code and boost vulnerability analysis. The code understanding ability of a pre-trained model is highly related to its pre-training objectives. The semantic structure, e.g., control and data dependencies, of code is important for vulnerability analysis. However, existing pre-training objectives either ignore such structure or focus on learning to use it. The feasibility and benefits of learning the knowledge of analyzing semantic structure have not been investigated. To this end, this work proposes two novel pre-training objectives, namely Control Dependency Prediction (CDP) and Data Dependency Prediction (DDP), which aim to predict the statement-level control dependencies and token-level data dependencies, respectively, in a code snippet only based on its source code. During pre-training, CDP and DDP can guide the model to learn the knowledge required for analyzing fine-grained dependencies in code. After pre-training, the pre-trained model can boost the understanding of vulnerable code during fine-tuning and can directly be used to perform dependence analysis for both partial and complete functions. To demonstrate the benefits of our pre-training objectives, we pre-train a Transformer model named PDBERT with CDP and DDP, fine-tune it on three vulnerability analysis tasks, i.e., vulnerability detection, vulnerability classification, and vulnerability assessment, and also evaluate it on program dependence analysis. Experimental results show that PDBERT benefits from CDP and DDP, leading to state-of-the-art performance on the three downstream tasks. Also, PDBERT achieves F1-scores of over 99% and 94% for predicting control and data dependencies, respectively, in partial and complete functions.",

            "abstract": "Smart contracts are Turing-complete programs that execute on the blockchain. Developers can implement complex contracts, such as auctions and lending, on Ethereum using the Solidity programming language. As an object-oriented language, Solidity provides libraries within its syntax to facilitate code reusability and reduce development complexity. Library misuse refers to the incorrect writing or usage of libraries, resulting in unexpected results, such as introducing vulnerabilities during library development or incorporating an unsafe library during contract development. Library misuse could lead to contract defects that cause financial losses. Currently, there is a lack of research on library misuse. To fill this gap, we collected more than 500 audit reports from the official websites of five audit companies and 223,336 real-world smart contracts from Etherscan to measure library popularity and library misuse. Then, we defined eight general patterns for library misuse; three of them occurring during library development and five during library utilization, which covers the entire library lifecycle. To validate the practicality of these patterns, we manually analyzed 1,018 realworld smart contracts and publicized our dataset. We identified 905 misuse cases across 456 contracts, indicating that library misuse is a widespread issue. Three patterns of misuse are found in more than 50 contracts, primarily due to developers lacking security awareness or underestimating negative impacts. Additionally, our research revealed that vulnerable libraries on Ethereum continue to be employed even after they have been deprecated or patched. Our findings can assist contract developers in preventing library misuse and ensuring the safe use of libraries.",

To comply with the regulations, websites need to display consent management UIs (i.e., cookie banners) implemented under the corresponding technical frameworks, allowing users to specify consents regarding their personal data processing. Although prior works have investigated the cookie banner compliance problems with GDPR, the technical specification has significantly changed. The compliance status under the latest framework remains unclear. There also lacks a systematic study of CCPA banner compliance. More importantly, most work have focused on detecting the regulation violations, whereas little is known about the possible culprits and causes. In this paper, we develop CSCHECKER, a browser-based tool that monitors and records consent strings on websites. We use CSCHECKER to analyze the GDPR and CCPA cookie banners, and reveal previously unknown compliance problems under both frame-works. We also discover and analyze possible miscreants leading to the violations, e.g., consent management providers that return wrong consent data. The comparison of the two frameworks inspires several suggestions about the design of cookie banners, the implementation of opt-out mechanisms, and the enforcement of user consent choices.",

            "abstract": "Currently, smart contract vulnerabilities (SCVs) have emerged as a major factor threatening the transaction security of blockchain. Existing state-of-the-art methods rely on deep learning to mitigate this threat. They treat each input contract as an independent entity and feed it into a deep learning model to learn vulnerability patterns by fitting vulnerability labels. It is a pity that they disregard the correlation between contracts, failing to consider the commonalities between contracts of the same type and the differences among contracts of different types. As a result, the performance of these methods falls short of the desired level. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Contrastive Learning Enhanced Automated Recognition Approach for Smart Contract Vulnerabilities, named Clear. In particular, Clear employs a con-trastive learning (CL) model to capture the fine-grained correlation information among contracts and generates correlation labels based on the relationships between contracts to guide the training pro-cess of the CL model. Finally, it combines the correlation and the semantic information of the contract to detect SCVs. Through an empirical evaluation of a large-scale real-world dataset of over 40K smart contracts and compare 13 state-of-the-art baseline methods. We show that Clear achieves (1) optimal performance over all base-line methods; (2) 9.73%-39.99% higher F1-score than existing deep learning methods.",

Rule-based detection approaches rely on predefined rules with limited capabilities and domain knowledge dependency. Additionally, using static information like opcodes and transactions for machine learning models fails to effectively characterize the Ponzi contracts, resulting in poor reliability and interpretability. In this paper, we propose PonziGuard, an efficient Ponzi scheme detection approach based on contract runtime behavior. Inspired by the observation that a contract's runtime behavior is more effective in disguising Ponzi contracts from the innocent contracts, Ponzi-Guard establishes a comprehensive graph representation called contract runtime behavior graph (CRBG), to accurately depict the behavior of Ponzi contracts. Furthermore, it formulates the detection process as a graph classification task, enhancing its overall effectiveness. We conducted comparative experiments on a ground-truth dataset and applied PonziGuard to Ethereum Mainnet. The results show that PonziGuard outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches and is also effective in open environments. Using PonziGuard, we have identified 805 Ponzi contracts on Ethereum Mainnet, which have resulted in an estimated economic loss of 281,700 Ether or approximately $500 million USD.",

To guide future research and solutions to these challenges, we conduct the first empirical study on Ethereum cryptographic practices. Through the analysis of 91,484,856 Ethereum transactions, 500 crypto-related contracts, and 483 StackExchange posts, we provide the first in-depth look at cryptographic tasks developers need to accomplish and identify five categories of obstacles they encounter. Furthermore, we conduct an online survey with 78 smart contract practitioners to explore their perspectives on these obstacles and elicit the underlying reasons. We find that more than half of practitioners face more challenges in cryptographic tasks compared to general business logic in smart contracts. Their feedback highlights the gap between low-level cryptographic APIs and high-level tasks they need to accomplish, emphasizing the need for improved cryptographic APIs, task-based templates, and effective assistance tools. Based on these findings, we provide practical implications for further improvements and outline future research directions.",

When a new third-party library vulnerability is disclosed, project maintainers need to determine whether their projects are affected by the vulnerability, which requires developers to invest substantial effort in assessment. However, existing tools face a series of issues: static analysis tools produce false alarms, dynamic analysis tools require existing tests and test generation tools have low success rates when facing complex vulnerabilities. Vulnerability exploits, as code snippets provided for reproducing vulnerabilities after disclosure, contain a wealth of vulnerability-related information. This study proposes a new method based on vulnerability exploits, called Vesta (Vulnerability Exploit-based Software Testing Auto-Generator), which provides vulnerability exploit tests as the basis for developers to decide whether to update dependencies. Vesta extends the search-based test generation methods by adding a migration step, ensuring the similarity between the generated test and the vulnerability exploit, which increases the likelihood of detecting potential library vulnerabilities in a project. We perform experiments on 30 vulnerabilities disclosed in the past five years, involving 60 vulnerability-project pairs, and compare the experimental results with the baseline method, Transfer. The success rate of Vesta is 71.7% which is a 53.4% improvement over Transfer in the effectiveness of verifying exploitable vulnerabilities.",

Security patches provide the necessary measures to protect software from attacks and vulnerabilities. In practice, it is difficult to identify whether patches have been integrated into software, especially if we only have binary files. Therefore, the ability to test whether a patch is applied to the target binary, a.k.a. patch presence test, is crucial for practitioners. However, it is challenging to obtain accurate semantic information from patches, which could lead to incorrect results. In this paper, we propose a new patch presence test framework named Ppt4j (Patch Presence Test forJava Binaries). Ppt4j is designed for open-source Java libraries. It takes Java binaries (i.e. bytecode files) as input, extracts semantic information from patches, and uses feature-based techniques to identify patch lines in the binaries. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach Ppt4j, we construct a dataset with binaries that include 110 vulnerabilities. The results show that Ppt4j achieves an F1 score of 98.5% with reasonable efficiency, improving the baseline by 14.2%. Furthermore, we conduct an in-the-wild evaluation of Ppt4j on JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA. The results suggest that a third-party library included in the software is not patched for two CVEs, and we have reported this potential security problem to the vendor.",

However, the support for the following assessment of the de-tected SVs has not yet been explored. SV assessment characterizes the detected SVs to prioritize limited remediation resources on the critical ones. To fill this gap, we aim to enable early vulnerability assessment based on SV-related issue reports (SIR). Besides, we observe the following concerns of the existing assessment techniques: 1) the assessment output lacks rationale and practical value; 2) the associations between Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) metrics have been ignored; 3) insufficient evaluation sce-narios and metrics. We address these concerns to enhance the prac-ticality of our proposed early vulnerability assessment approach (namely proEVA). Specifically, based on the observation of strong associations between CVSS metrics, we propose a prompt-based model to exploit such relations for CVSS metrics prediction. More-over, we design a curriculum-learning (CL) schedule to guide the model better learn such hidden associations during training. Aside from the standard classification metrics adopted in existing works, we propose two severity-aware metrics to provide a more compre-hensive evaluation regarding the prioritization of the high-severe SVs. Experimental results show that proEVA significantly outper-forms the baselines in both types of metrics. We further discuss the transferability of the prediction model regarding the upgrade of the assessment system, an important yet overlooked evaluation scenario in existing works. The results verify that proEVA is more efficient and flexible in migrating to different assessment systems.",

            "abstract": "Test migration, which enables the reuse of test cases crafted with knowledge and creativity by testers across various platforms and programming languages, has exhibited effectiveness in mobile app testing. However, unit test migration at the source code level has not garnered adequate attention and exploration. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-language and cross-platform test migration methodology, named MUT, which consists of four modules: code mapping, test case filtering, test case translation, and test case adaptation. MUT initially calculates code mappings to establish associations between source and target projects, and identifies suitable unit tests for migration from the source project. Then, MUT's code translation component generates a syntax tree by parsing the code to be migrated and progressively converts each node in the tree, ultima tely generating the target tests, which are compiled and executed in the target project. Moreover, we develop a web tool to assist developers in test migration. The effectiveness of our approach has been validated on five prevalent functional domain projects within the open-source community. We migrate a total of 550 unit tests and submitted pull requests to augment test code in the target projects on GitHub. By the time of this paper submission, 253 of these tests have already been merged into the projects (including 197 unit tests in the Luliyucoordinate-LeetCode project and 56 unit tests in the Rangerlee-HtmlParser project). Through running these tests, we identify 5 bugs, and 2 functional defects, and submitted corresponding issues to the project. The evaluation substantiates that MUT's test migration is both viable and beneficial across programming languages and different projects.",

            "abstract": "Reentrancy, a notorious vulnerability in smart contracts, has led to millions of dollars in financial loss. However, current smart contract vulnerability detection tools suffer from a high false positive rate in identifying contracts with reentrancy vulnerabilities. Moreover, only a small portion of the detected reentrant contracts can actually be exploited by hackers, making these tools less effective in securing the Ethereum ecosystem in practice. In this paper, we propose BlockWatchdog, a tool that focuses on detecting reentrancy vulnerabilities by identifying attacker contracts. These attacker contracts are deployed by hackers to exploit vulnerable contracts automatically. By focusing on attacker contracts, BlockWatchdog effectively detects truly exploitable reentrancy vulnerabilities by identifying reentrant call flow. Additionally, BlockWatchdog is capable of detecting new types of reentrancy vulnerabilities caused by poor designs when using ERC tokens or user-defined interfaces, which cannot be detected by current rulebased tools. We implement BlockWatchdog using cross-contract static dataflow techniques based on attack logic obtained from an empirical study that analyzes attacker contracts from 281 attack incidents. BlockWatchdog is evaluated on 421,889 Ethereum contract bytecodes and identifies 113 attacker contracts that target 159 victim contracts, leading to the theft of Ether and tokens valued at approximately 908.6 million USD. Notably, only 18 of the identified 159 victim contracts can be reported by current reentrancy detection tools.",

            "abstract": "Code idioms are commonly used patterns, techniques, or practices that aid in solving particular problems or specific tasks across multiple software projects. They can improve code quality, performance, and maintainability, and also promote program standardization and reuse across projects. However, identifying code idioms is significantly challenging, as existing studies have still suffered from three main limitations. First, it is difficult to recognize idioms that span non-contiguous code lines. Second, identifying idioms with intricate data flow and code structures can be challenging. More-over, they only extract dataset-specific idioms, so common idioms or well-established code/design patterns that are rarely found in datasets cannot be identified. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach, named Idiomine, to automatically extract generic and specific idioms from both Java projects and libraries. We perform program analysis on Java functions to transform them into concise PDGs, for integrating the data flow and control flow of code fragments. We then develop a novel chain structure, Data-driven Control Chain (DCC), to extract sub-idioms that possess contiguous semantic meanings from PDGs. After that, we utilize GraphCodeBERT to generate code embeddings of these sub-idioms and perform density-based clustering to obtain frequent sub-idioms. We use heuristic rules to identify interrelated sub-idioms among the frequent ones. Finally, we employ ChatGPT to synthesize interrelated sub-idioms into potential code idioms and infer real idioms from them. We conduct well-designed experiments and a user study to evaluate Idiomine's correctness and the practical value of the extracted idioms. Our experimental results show that Idiomine effectively extracts more idioms with better performance in most metrics. We compare our approach with Haggis and ChatGPT, Idiomine outperforms them by 22.8% and 35.5% in Idiom Set Precision (ISP) and by 9.7% and 22.9% in Idiom...",

            "abstract": "During software development, vulnerabilities have posed a significant threat to users. Patches are the most effective way to combat vulnerabilities. In a large-scale software system, testing the presence of a security patch in every affected binary is crucial to ensure system security. Identifying whether a binary has been patched for a known vulnerability is challenging, as there may only be small differences between patched and vulnerable versions. Existing approaches mainly focus on detecting patches that are compiled in the same compiler options. However, it is common for developers to compile programs with very different compiler options in different situations, which causes inaccuracy for existing methods. In this paper, we propose a new approach named\nP\nS\n3\n, referring to precise patch presence test based on semantic-level symbolic signature.\nP\nS\n3\nexploits symbolic emulation to extract signatures that are stable under different compiler options. Then\nP\nS\n3\ncan precisely test the presence of the patch by comparing the signatures between the reference and the target at semantic level. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we constructed a dataset consisting of 3,631 (CVE, binary) pairs of 62 recent CVEs in four C/C++ projects. The experimental results show that\nP\nS\n3\nachieves scores of 0.82, 0.97, and 0.89 in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score, respectively.\nP\nS\n3\noutperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by improving 33% in terms of F1 score and remains stable in different compiler options.",

            "abstract": "Bugs in smart contracts may have devastating effects as they tend to cause financial loss. According to a recent study, accounting bugs are the most common kind of bugs in smart contracts that are beyond automated tools during pre-deployment auditing. The reason lies in that these bugs are usually in the core business logic and hence contract-specific. They are analogous to functional bugs in traditional software, which are largely beyond automated bug finding tools whose effectiveness hinges on uniform and machine checkable characteristics of bugs. It was also reported that accounting bugs are the second-most difficult to find through manual auditing, due to the need of understanding underlying business models. We observe that a large part of business logic in smart contracts can be modeled by a few primitive operations like those in a bank, such as deposit, withdraw, loan, and pay-off, or by their combinations. The properties of these operations can be clearly defined and checked by an abstract type system that models high-order information such as token units, scaling factors, and financial types. We hence develop a novel type propagation and checking system with the aim of identifying accounting bugs. Our evaluation on a large set of 57 existing accounting bugs in 29 real-world projects shows that 58% of the accounting bugs are type errors. Our system catches 87.9% of these type errors. In addition, applying our technique to auditing a large project in a very recent auditing contest has yielded the identification of 6 zero-day accounting bugs with 4 leading to direct fund loss",

Unlike normal loans, flash loans allow borrowers to borrow large assets without upfront collaterals deposits. Malicious adversaries use flash loans to gather large assets to exploit vulnerable DeFi protocols. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for automated syn-thesis of adversarial transactions that exploit DeFi protocols using flash loans. To bypass the complexity of a DeFi protocol, we propose a new technique to approximate the DeFi protocol functional behaviors using numerical methods (polynomial approximation and nearest-neighbor interpolation). We then construct an optimization query using the approximated functions of the DeFi protocol to find an adversarial attack constituted of a sequence of functions invocations with optimal parameters that gives the maximum profit. To improve the accuracy of the approximation, we propose a novel counterexample driven approximation refinement technique. We implement our framework in a tool named FlashSyn. We evaluate FlashSyn on 16 DeFi protocols that were victims to flash loan attacks and 2 DeFi protocols from Damn Vulnerable DeFi challenges. FlashSyn automatically synthesizes an adversarial attack for 16 of the 18 benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in finding possible flash loan attacks.",

            "abstract": "As an essential component in Ethereum and other blockchains, token assets have been interacted with by diverse smart contracts. Effective permission policies of smart contracts must prevent token assets from being manipulated by unauthorized adversaries. Recent efforts have studied the accessibility of privileged functions or state variables to unauthorized users. However, little attention is paid to how publicly accessible functions of smart contracts can be manipulated by adversaries to steal users' digital assets. This attack is mainly caused by the permission re-delegation (PRD) vulnerability. In this work, we propose PRETTYSMART, a bytecode-level Permission re-delegation vulnerability detector for Smart contracts. Our study begins with an empirical study on 0.43 million open- source smart contracts, revealing that five types of widely-used permission constraints dominate 98% of the studied contracts. Accordingly, we propose a mechanism to infer these permission constraints, as well as an algorithm to identify constraints that can be bypassed by unauthorized adversaries. Based on the identification of permission constraints, we propose to detect whether adversaries could manipulate the privileged token management functionalities of smart contracts. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Prettysmart, which achieves the highest precision score and detects 118 new PRD vulnerabilities.",

            "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach for rapid testing of blockchain consensus clients under conditions that closely match real-world scenarios. Coupled with a hybrid discrete-event based network simulator, our proposed system has the ability to replay transactions that occurred on Ethereum's mainnet. By remapping existing transaction data from real-world blockchains, we are able to observe how Ethereum's PoA protocol behaves under various conditions. Our experiment results show we can simulate Ethereum's PoA consensus protocol with a high degree of scalability.",

The intersection of these two forces offers exciting opportunities to tackle global challenges, foster the creation of an equitable and ecologically sound society, and establish the foundation for realizing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Although they hold strategic importance, digital and sustainable transformations are frequently approached independently. This separation is due, in part, to the intricate and multifaceted nature of the relationship between digitalization and sustainability. An in-depth examination of various research outcomes highlights four primary areas in which sustainability and digitalization converge: Energy, Governance, Systems, and Innovation. The Governance domain is further elaborated in the context of planning and policy-making themes. Energy considerations encompass emissions, consumption, and production. Innovation is closely linked with business strategies, values, and environmental concerns. Lastly, systems are intricately connected with networks, Industry 4.0, and supply chain dynamics. These findings aim to provide insights and inspire further research and discussions on the potential interplay between sustainability and digitalization.",

This coincided with the emergence of brands like Ring, Blink, Wyze, SimpliSafe, and Vivint, which specialized in smart home security. These brands offer a range of products, including front-door cameras, infrared motion sensors/ detectors, and in-home cameras providing various views of the house. One notable drawback of these product ecosystems is their reliance on a proprietary mobile application and a smartphone capable of running it. If the application ceased to receive support or the company went out of business, the associated hardware might no longer function as intended, resulting in unnecessary e-waste and unsustainable security practices. The proposed system design addressed the dependency on proprietary software by utilizing flexible software design within a modular motion detection security system. The proposed design entails an ecosystem that could be customized to meet specific user requirements and specifications. It was designed with sustainability in mind, capable of being thoroughly customized to different tools and services.",

Consequently, the number of amicable accident reports is unmeasurable. An effective management of accident information is a crucial element, especially in the absence of an information system for amicable accident report management. However, the use of traditional centralized systems is critical, as long as they fail to present secure, transparent, reliable, and trustworthy platforms for accident's report management. This paper provides an innovative solution. It's a use case study of developing a Blockchain and interplanetary file system (IPFS) protocol-based system for traffic report management, using a mobile application. This application could be used at the time of the traffic accident. By using the application, road users can fill out the accident report at the same time as the accident while maintaining data authenticity, integrity, and reliability, and without the need for a third trusted party. Furthermore, the application reflects the safety performance of insurance companies and allows them to put an end to oversights, inaccuracies, or incorrect information when completing the amicable accident report. A better understanding and streamlining the process of handling accident reports is an essential component to enhance emergency response, promote road safety, and mitigate the economic impacts of traffic incidents, for both users and insurance companies.",

            "abstract": "Healthcare data contains large amounts of personal information and is privacy sensitive. The healthcare sector needs privacy protection to keep private and sensitive information safe from unauthorized access. Security problems are raised by fundamental sharing difficulties involving personal information setting to securely forecast sensitive medical data using blockchain technology to address this issue. To solve the problem issue, propose a quasi-sensitive identification of blockchain security using tried-and-true partition fold padding encryption (PFPE) to improve the security of healthcare transactions. The Q-Pragmatic-Sensitive Feature Analysis (QPSFA) determines the terms related to sensitive privacy features. Finally, the Provable Fold Padding Encryption, and the authentication procedure is completed by using an Access Verification-based role to verify it. To ensure that, in a blockchain, the private data are cleansed and placed into data blocks. This suggests that the proposed system outperforms high accuracy up to 90%, as well security up to 94 % high insecurity compared to previous approaches regarding sensitivity and specificity rate performance and prediction accuracy.",

It also present technological, ethical, legal, and clinical constraints. Therefore, to provide a just and effective procedure that improves patient experience and trust, an final result of organ-transplantation & donation system is needed. Numerous Ethereum blockchain-based private solutions are available to facilitate organ donation and transplantation administration; nevertheless, their scalability, accuracy, and authenticity are limited, despite their substantial flexibility. The suggested web platform for managing organ donations, powered by Python, is intended to provide an easy-to-use and safe interface that will expedite and simplify the organ donation procedure. The platform prioritizes user verification and offers unique features for donors, recipients, and administrators. Users can create accounts and manage comprehensive profiles that include personal data, medical histories, and donation preferences. To maximize the likelihood of successful organ transplants, a sophisticated matching system that uses algorithms to match possible donors with recipients based on compatibility parameters including organ type, location, and urgency is essential to its operation. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed organ donation model, the python driven-model performance parameter are overlaid on the Blockchain-driven performance parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model offers better Scalability, Accuracy, Authentication with significant Flexibility. Further, the proposed python-Driven model achieves approximately 8% and 10% improvements in Accuracy and Scalability respectively against the existing model.",

            "abstract": "The pervasive presence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices across diverse critical industrial contexts underscores the crucial role of authentication mechanisms to protect applications from misuses and violations. Those authentication schemes not relying on passwords are built by using cryptography protocols so as to achieve high security levels. However, their efficacy relies on the confidentiality of cryptographic keys and has limitations when implemented on resource-constrained devices. This paper introduces a novel approach to devise an authentication scheme without relying on the storage of keys in device memory and without the presence of a centralised entity. We develop a lightweight mutual authentication scheme utilizing Static Random Access Memory (SRAM)-Physical Unclonable Function (PUF), which leverage on the inherent randomness of SRAM obtained during its manufacturing process to create keys. The proposed solution is further fortified by blockchain technology that is used to provide a decentralised management authority. By incorporating decentralization, scalability, freshness, and non-repudiation, this research contributes to the advancement of secure authentication protocols for IoT-enabled critical industrial applications.",

This paper aims to construct a digital transformation capability maturity index system for logistics enterprises, to indicate the direction of digital transformation for logistics enterprises and to promote their digital transformation process. First, the hierarchical structure of the indicator system is established: 48 indicators in total. Among them, there are 4 primary indicators, namely, digital strategic planning and organizational management capacity, infrastructure construction, business process and management digitization and digital performance, 12 secondary indicators and 32 tertiary indicators. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is applied to determine the weights of the indicators. Finally, through indicator weights analysis, relevant strategies for logistics enterprises to enhance digital transformation capability maturity are proposed, such as intelligent logistics planning algorithms should be used to improve the coordination of enterprise logistics planning, digital benefits-oriented implementation of digital transformation, top management should strongly support enterprise digital transformation, and digital security technology to strengthen the security and management and maintenance, and so on.",

We then formalize five key challenges and propose solutions for the same. An infrastructure, including blockchains, smart contracts, satellite communication, and ground controllers, is proposed. The relevance of keeping track of any rogue UAVs is emphasized and a possible reputation system applicable to either individual UAVs or the coalition members is identified. To improve scalability and enhance fault tolerance, four types of configurations of the UAVs in a swarm are discussed. Finally, the use of machine learning tools to enhance mission success in a swarm environment is also discussed.",

Due to this complex process and waiting time, the public tends to go through middlemen and third-party agents, which sometimes leads to fraud. This paper provides a detailed review and limitations of the current land registry system, both paper-oriented and centralized online system, as well as a review of current research on blockchain-based land registry processes. To make the land registry system more secure and faster than the available solutions, this proposes a modified solution that will mitigate the limitations of the related work by using a three-tier structure, including a government body responsible for taking permission and overlooking the entire transaction, a buyer or seller, and further banks responsible for overlooking payment transactions. The three parties approve the transaction, and then the transaction details are added to the Ethereum blockchain network. The solution also solves the transaction size issue by storing the meta data on the main chain and non-transactional data on the IPFS network, which will significantly reduce the load on the network.",

The rise of blockchain has encouraged researchers to consider the decentralization framework for developing online social networks to resolve the challenges mentioned above. In a decentralized ecosystem, no one entity has absolute access to data and the power to enforce arbitrary decisions. The benefits of this include ownership over personal data, censorship resistance, data security, and improved control over user-generated content. In this paper, we propose the design of Ethnos, a social networking application built to harness the powers of blockchain and distributed storage technology to heighten the security and reliability of users as well as their data. In that context, suitable smart contracts have been fabricated. This paper also prospects integration of two-factor user authentication and trust score checks with Ethnos to corroborate the trustworthiness of both user and data. In addition, Ethnos incorporates a remuneration system to compensate users for their contribution to and engagement with the platform.",

During medical services, privacy protection and the integrity of sensitive medical information are critical concerns. Blockchain technology, renowned for its immutable and decentralized nature, presents a promising solution to safeguarding these critical records. This research paper delves into the patient perspective concerning the utilization of blockchain to fortify healthcare document security. In addition, the blockchain\u2019s properties were assessed concerning the healthcare supply chain using the Task Technology Fit (TTF) framework and the Fit-Viability Model (FVM). An empirical study of 296 customers/patients and healthcare professionals from medical sector shall evaluate fit and viability of blockchain technology adoption for storage and protection of medical records. The Fit and Viability framework was analyzed implementing structural equation modelling to access the adoption of blockchain technology in medical sector. Research findings indicate that task-technology fit, and environment technology fit significantly influenced functional benefits and symbolic benefits respectively. Further function benefits and viability had significant positive impact on BCT adoption. However Symbolic benefits were found to be insignificant for BCT adoption. In conclusion, this research advocates for a paradigm shift in healthcare document security, emphasizing patient empowerment and trust through blockchain technology. By centering on patient perspectives, concerns, and preferences, this paper advocates for the adoption of blockchain solutions having a significant impact due to functional benefits that not only fortify document security but also prioritize consumers/patient\u2019s confidence and participation in their healthcare journey.",

            "abstract": "Cervical cancer is a serious health concern that entails high risks for individuals due to delayed detection and treatment worldwide. Formal screening for the condition is challenging in both developed and developing countries due to a number of factors, including medical costs, access to healthcare facilities, social norms, and delayed symptom manifestation. Bypassing conventional, time-consuming medical procedures, machine learning presents a promising path for the efficient and economical early diagnosis of a variety of diseases, including cervical cancer. However, the fact that existing machine classification techniques for identifying diseases rely heavily on the predictive accuracy of a single classifier poses a significant drawback. Single classification methods alone might not provide the best predictions because of bias, over-fitting, improper handling of noisy data, and outliers, among other issues. Moreover, machine learning algorithms deals with sensitive patient data therefore Security measures are necessary to prevent unauthorized access and safeguard individual and organisations\u2019 privacy, guard against model tampering. This paper proposes a novel framework for cervical cancer automated prediction using ensemble model training and blockchain smart contracts. The research records a noteworthy improvement in prediction test accuracy of 99.7% and train accuracy of 93%, surpassing the accuracy of predictions made by individual categorization techniques.",

Also, the impact of demonetization on the expansion of digital transactions can vary based on several factors, including the readiness of the digital infrastructure, the level of financial inclusion, and the overall economic landscape of a country. However earlier all users have depended on physical transaction but after covid and other reasons the many users are not interested to do same tasks manually. Instead of that it required to do the transactions in online platforms. For example, e-fund transfers, digital wallets, mobile payments etc. In this regards it can see one thing that network size was increased. As the network expands, the risk of attacks seeking sensitive user information, like login credentials and credit card details, rises. With many users relying on credit cards for online transactions, safeguarding login credentials becomes crucial to prevent unauthorized access during transactions. Based on research gaps it can say that a new and secure credit card storage system will be useful for e-commerce. In most cases, sensitive and classified data or information is presented in unencrypted formats to remote machines resulting in unauthorized access and disclosure. This proposed work has explained with 2-stage mechanism in which one stage at banker side and other at e-commerce side. The first stage performed with tokenization (with XOR operation) and AES cryptosystem. In second stage, providing security by using two factor authentication of generating secret pin along with OTP.

Additionally, it could also result in substantial financial and reputational repercussions for both governmental bodies and pharmaceutical companies. Thorough research and detailed investigation have shown substantial advantages to using blockchain technology over traditional systems. The traditional client-server centralized systems face significant complications concerning security and traceability. In contrast, the proposed blockchain-based architecture assures transparency and open-ness within the medicine supply chain. The architecture takes advantage by leveraging blockchain technology with respect to decentralization, tamper-proofing, and Traceability. Each product registered on the blockchain possesses a QR code for detailed information retrieval and ownership history, aiding in identifying counterfeit origins. Furthermore, each product also comes with authenticated certificates and lab reports. These reports are verified by drug administration authorities to strengthen the reliability of the product. As a result, developed system offers robust measures against counterfeit origins as compared to traditional and other blockchain based systems.",

Ransomware has variants, and the attackers keep changing the nature of these variants. This review paper studies the complex background of these two threats and scrutinizes the actual challenges, and problems that the banking industry and financial institutions face. These threats, though distinct in nature, share commonalities, such as financial motivations and sophisticated techniques. We focus on examining the newly emerged variants of ransomware while we provide a comprehensive idea of cryptojacking and its nature. This paper involves a detailed breakdown of the specific threats posed by cryptojacking and ransomware. It explores the techniques cybercriminals use, the variabilities they look for, and the potential consequences for financial institutions and their customers. This paper also finds out how cybercriminals change their techniques following the security upgrades, and why financial firms including banks need to be proactive about cyber threats. Additionally, this paper reviews the background study of some existing papers, finds the research gaps that need to be addressed, and provides suggestions including a conclusion and future scope on those disputes. Lastly, we introduce a Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) approach for up-to-date cyber threat hunting processes for minimizing both cryptojacking and ransomware attacks in the banking industry.",

            "abstract": "Digital land registration plays a pivotal role in modernizing and securing land ownership records. Issues with traditional land registration processes include slowness, fraud, and a lack of openness. The conventional land registration system, which is still in use in many nations, has several problems, including corruption, integrity issues, and inaccurate data. Document discrepancies resulting from data errors discovered during the land registration procedure give rise to ownership rights disputes. One use case involves several middleman and central institutions is land registration, which boosts trust and confidence in the system. By eliminating intermediaries and centralized organizations, land registration will be quicker. It is challenging to keep track of who owns what land when hundreds or even thousands of land records need to be kept up to date. A straightforward decentralized land registration application was created using the Ethereum Blockchain. This technology allows the transaction process to have just two clients (buyer, seller) and to be visible at all times. This paper presents a novel approach to digital land registration using blockchain technology and smart contracts.

            "abstract": "The preeminent cryptocurrency globally, Bitcoin, facilitates secure online transactions, ensuring financial privacy during swift cash transactions. Recent years have witnessed heightened consumer interest in the Bitcoin ecosystem. The research objective is to scrutinize two prominent approaches for cryptocurrency price forecasting: one leveraging time series methodology using Prophet and the other incorporating sentiment analysis from social media, particularly Twitter. A novel CNN-LSTM layer is proposed for comprehensive evaluation. The algorithms undergo training on real-time financial data streams, and performance is assessed through metrics like accuracy score, Mean Absolute Percentage Error, and R2 Score. Findings reveal that the integration of sentiment analysis with the CNN-LSTM pipeline yields significantly enhanced accuracy of 0.94 on the training data and 0.91 on the testing data in aligning with price trends compared to the Prophet algorithm over Bitcoin closing prices.",

            "abstract": "Patient care has certainly enriched by implementing digitalization in healthcare. This digital transformation has posed obstacles with data security and privacy. By the introduction of e-health, huge volumes of sensitive and classified data is digitally processed and the likelihood of numerous personal health records (PHR) rules infractions or breaches has drastically increased by implementation of digitalization. Even with the advancement in technologies, it will take due time before a system development can effectively address the security issues and give patients, who are the natural guardians of their health data a total control over their personal data. Hence, there is an urgent need for a patient-centric system that maintains data privacy and gives patients a total control over their PHR. To redefine E-Health security, the cutting-edge technologies comprising of Distributed Hash Table (DHT), Blockchain, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), and Inter Planetary File solution (IPFS) needs integration. IPFS and DHT enables in improving Data privacy by providing a reliable and effective decentralized and distributed storage solution. Enabling safe access control over this information, a Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT) leverages the transparent and unchangeable characteristics of Blockchain. The idea of SSI, which gives patients control over their digital identities and to manage their E-Health data, is fundamental to this paradigm. This study advocates for the widespread implementation of patient-powered electronic health record management system. Additionally providing encouraging paths to improve data security and privacy in the domain of digital healthcare.",

The main challenging drawback of this cloud storage is Data Provenance. Data provenance or data lineage is a collection of data which provides the detail information about the data origin. In this paper we look for the present cloud provenance and their security modulations which work with the blockchain network. The main work of this paper is how provenance is categorized, what is the need, why it is needed, how it is described, and way to publicize it. This paper also analyzes the challenges facing provenance anthology and a variety of models used to overcome them. The ideal outcome of the paper is tamper-proof records can be obtained using the provenance concept merged with blockchain technology. Cloud storage is used to collect different form of provenance records. A DPAEBS-Chain (Data Provenance- Attribute enabled blockchain service) chain is designed and which will validate the records available in cloud and embeds into blockchain storage of transactions enhances the reliability with low overhead, user privacy and tamper-proof provenance with high security measures.",

            "abstract": "The use of information technology to trade information, deliver services, and other things is becoming more and more commonplace in the era of technological advancement. Tendering is one such area where the public and private sectors collaborate. E-tendering is a procurement technique that uses the internet and digital technologies to automate and simplify the whole bidding or tendering process. This makes it easier for the bidders to browse through all of the open tenders and select one to proceed with. But it frequently results in a number of challenges that both bids and bidders must deal with. The system is inefficient because of scale and transparency problems brought on by its centralized architecture. Additionally, the system frequently shares information about tenders with other outside organizations, which compromises the confidentiality and integrity of the tenders. To manage these issues, a decentralized method is used in the deployment of the Blockchain e-tendering system. Consequently, the procurement procedures will have the opportunity to leverage the potential of blockchain technology to enhance security and transparency. This research aims to provide an electronic tendering system that is transparent, liquidate, and safe. It will manage tender allocation and use smart contracts to automate the underlying processes with the least amount of human interaction possible.",

However, the current music industry demotivates artists in a number of ways, including copyright violations while sharing, being softcopied, and internet uploads. Artists who make people happy experience a great collapse as a result. In this paper, we'll talk about how blockchain technology can be applied to music platforms to make them more safe and transparent than the current system. We offer an alternative online database system that manages copyright between individuals and has the quality of being tamper-proof. This system leverages the Ethereum blockchain network to store data. Using smart contracts, we offer quick and efficient payments in ethereum using available accounts in the digial wallet and block explorer to follow information that is kept in the network. The paper's design and implementation are demonstrated in detail. The files that are softcopied from the system and files that are uploaded illegally will be removed by this system.",

This weakness is shown by how hard it's for growers to sell their crops at prices that are allowed to be fair. In order to break this problem, our group came up with the idea for the Agri-Connect PWA app, which is a web operation that makes life easy for growers. Our PWA, which is called Agri-Connect, gives growers the freedom to decide how important they want to charge for their recently gathered goods. growers are more likely to get the plutocrat they earn from the trade of their goods if they do not pay commissions to mediators and rather make direct connections with guests. Also, the original portion shops, which are also used to store the particulars, help with the distribution of ranch goods and with getting those goods to where they need to go. Within each portion shop, there are separate doors for managing orders and storing information about guests and growers. All of these spots are translated with blockchain technology to make sure they work and are open to everyone. Our Progressive Web operation(PWA) works well with WhatsApp, so growers can now partake information about their crops and talk to buyers through an easy-to-use point. This was possible because our PWA was linked to WhatsApp. Because of this, it's easier for growers to vend their goods. Our thing is to close the gap between husbandry and technology so that growers can have further control over their businesses and make further plutocrats. We plan to do this by taking advantage of how numerous people use WhatsApp and how easy it's to use. It's a one-of-a-kind result that was made to change the agrarian business and give growers more fair ways to vend their goods. This exact answer is called Agri-Connect PWA.",

            "abstract": "Integration of biometric authentication, dynamic CVV, and Machine Learning Model Having the capacity to enhance the security of financial transaction systems. The recommended method is to employ biometric identifying techniques, such fingerprint scanning, for user authentication. Before transmitting the transaction data via JSON to a backend API, the recommended method encrypts it. To find any possible suspicious activity, it is advised to evaluate transaction data using a machine learning model that is part of the backend API. It is advised to steer clear of any transaction that the machine learning algorithm flags as fraudulent. In the event that the machine learning model finds no evidence of fraudulent activity, processing the transaction is the advised course of action. Installing a dynamic CVV system is one technique to potentially increase security. By creating a new CVV for each transaction completed using this approach, fraudsters would find it far more difficult to reuse stolen card data. One proposed fix for the system is blockchain technology, which would provide a safe and transparent ledger to store records of every transaction. By strengthening transaction record security, the recommended fix would make it more difficult for fraudsters to modify or alter them.",

Traditional loyalty programs often face challenges related to security, transparency, and trust, leading to issues such as fraud and customer skepticism. The proposed model outlines the design and implementation of a blockchainbased loyalty program, ensuring a secure and immutable ledger for tracking customer transactions and rewards. Smart contracts, self-executing contracts with predefined rules, are utilized to automate and enforce the terms of the loyalty program, reducing the potential for disputes and enhancing transparency. The decentralized nature of the blockchain ensures that customer data is securely stored and accessible only to authorized parties, addressing privacy concerns prevalent in centralized loyalty systems. This research employs a mix of theoretical analysis and practical implementation to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the blockchain-based loyalty program model. The proposed Ethereum Blockchain model stands out with a significantly higher throughput of 5300 transactions per day, accompanied by an exceptional transaction transparency score of 99.5 .",

This paper proposes a solution using blockchain and powerful algorithms. The recommended approach uses blockchain's immutability and safety, machine learning to discover outliers, and NLP to organize data. This coordinated strategy automates and opens government records to increase data quality, accessibility, and speed. Several tests and performance assessments compared the recommended solution to the traditional record-keeping method. Finding anomalies is faster using machine learning anomaly detection and natural language processing record sorting. This ensures data accuracy and clarity in real time. Spreading blockchain keeps documents secure and unchangeable. This makes changing difficult for those who shouldn't. The study found that the proposed strategy might improve public record management. It improves transparency, a crucial trait for responsible leadership, in a powerful, safe, and automated way using blockchain technology and cutting-edge algorithms.",

Smart home is a concept that is been trending these days with IoT devices taking control of the houses making people's lives much easier. But the data collected from them is not stored properly. With the traditional methodology where the data is stored on a centralized cloud network, it is prone to cyberattacks, single point of failure and also involves tampering. Because of this, the sensitive data of the users are compromised from time to time. This arises mainly due to the centralized network system of the cloud and to tackle that, we approached a decentralized network system which Blockchain. It enables us to store data across the world that too in a decentralized format resulting in a more secure and safe environment for those sensitive data. This is our proposed solution as well. To secure the smart home data with blockchain technology and to further enhance reliability, our proposed approach incorporates a modified version of SHA-512. In summary, our focus is on securing Smart Home IoT data in the cloud by integrating blockchain technology, advanced encryption methods, and robust hash algorithms like SHA-512 to ensure the utmost protection and authorized access for large-scale datasets from diverse Smart Home sources.",

Key to realizing these abstract ideas is the development of specialized hardware architectures and components. Based on the outcomes of the performance assessment, iterative refinement is carried out to fix the hardware's flaws and enhance its functionality. As a result of this iterative process, hardware is kept up to date to suit the ever-shifting requirements of Web3.0 and edge intelligence.

Despite their popularity, these networks are centralized, allowing the companies that own them to monitor and track their users' activities. This has given rise to serious concerns regarding the privacy and security of user data, which are often sold to third parties for profit. Given the massive value of user data in today's and tomorrow's world, many people are concerned about this issue. While decentralized, community-driven applications have emerged as a potential solution to this problem, none have yet been able to compete with centralized social network platforms. Due to those facts, this research aimed to propose a decentralized social network architecture that would incorporate the basic functionalities of a social media platform while ensuring the privacy and security of users' data, which would be stored locally on their devices. A thorough study of the existing centralized and decentralized social media platforms was conducted to identify the path for this research. The proposed protocol offers a decentralized and secure social media platform architecture that provides true ownership of user data along with decentralized data integrity and caching.",

            "abstract": "Crime pattern analysis and other forms of predictive policing are becoming indispensable tools for today's police forces. Hybrid Blockchain-Machine Learning Predictive Policing (HBL-PP) is a new method introduced by this study that aims to transform the sector by bringing together the best features of blockchain technology and machine learning algorithms. SecureCrimeChain guarantees the safe handling of crime-related data, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are used for advanced crime pattern analysis in HBL-PP. When compared to conventional approaches, HBL-PP performs much better in experimental evaluations. SecureCrimeChain guarantees the best degree of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, outperforming other techniques. DeepCrimeNet has comparable performance and comes in a close second. FairPredict Pro, although fairness-aware, maintains a balance between equity and prediction accuracy.",
